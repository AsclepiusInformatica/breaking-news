<em><strong>Breaking News</strong> is a series on the self-inflicted fractures breaking the news business. This second report is on the "ad tech tax" everyone pays, in dollars, time, and readership.</em>

I can think of nothing that has done more harm to the Internet than ad tech. It interferes with everything we try to do on the Web. It has cheapened and debased advertising and spawned criminal empires.     
<div><cite>&mdash;Bob Hoffman (<a href="http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/">The Ad Contrarian</a>) quoted by <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-click-fraud/"><em>Bloomberg Business</em></a></cite></div>

My 93-year-old mom called the other day, almost in tears. Her browser had been taken over by popups that re-popped up every time she closed them. The slimy site (that she'd clicked to from RealClearPolitics) and its putrid popups persisted even after quitting and relaunching the browser. My mother was another victim of modern advertising.

<h2>Old hotness, new and busted</h2>

<img align="right" width="400" src="https://github.com/hearvox/breaking-news/blob/master/assets/ad-plymouth.jpg?raw=true">Once upon a time, an advertiser contracted a media agency to place specific advertisments in specific publications. Publishers provided "tear sheets" proving the ads had run. The agency got 15% of ad's cost; the publishers pocketed the rest.

This type of advertising built the brands of nearly every major product and service you've ever heard of. So, obviously, the entire industry process needed radical disruption.

Legions of brogrammers began innovating advertising technologies, claiming to: "Build, run, measure and optimize retargeting-driven display campaigns." "Deliver cohesive messaging to qualified consumers at scale." "Analyze first-party premium publisher site level data to pinpoint active consumer intent." (All real company slogans, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=YCMTSU">YCMTSU</a>.) Mainly they did, though, was radically raise thir rates.

The old 15% cut for media agencies has creeped up to <a href="http://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Programmatic-Value-Layers-March-2016-FINALv2.pdf">55% in 2014</a>. In 2015, the creeps <a href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/270487/study-finds-only-40-of-digital-buys-going-to-work.html">took 60%</a>.

<h2>Ad targetting: bullseye or bullshit?</h2>

<blockquote>
A user clicks on a website and suddenly her Internet address and browsing history are packaged and whisked off to an auction site, where software, on behalf of advertisers, scrutinizes her profile (or an anonymized version of it) and determines whether to bid to place an ad next to that article. Ford Motor could pay to put its ads on websites for car buffs, or, with the help of cookies, track car buffs wherever they may be online. Ford might want to target males age 25-40 for pickup-truck ads, or, better yet, anybody in that age group who’s even read about pickups in the past six months.

"Ad tech" is the new automated way we buy, sell, deliver, and display online advertising. The surcharge for this data-driven automation is the "ad tech tax."

You're free to try to figure out how a typical ad buy from this Interactive Advertising Bureau chart of the <a href="http://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Programmatic-Value-Layers-March-2016-FINALv2.pdf">Anatomy of a Programmatic CPM</a> (cost per thousand impressions):

<img src="https://github.com/hearvox/breaking-news/blob/master/assets/IAB-Programmatic-CPM.png?raw=true" />  


<h2>Making a bad impression</h2>

Ad tech bills advertisers by the "impression," a semi-mythical event, hypothesized by the <a href="http://measurementnow.net/press-release-media-rating-council-updates-viewable-ad-impression-measurement-guidelines/#.V5ELiZMrLOZ">Media Rating Council</a> to occur when half an advert's pixels are "in view" for one continuous second (two seconds for video ads).

But <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/welcome-to-the-internet-of-thingies-615-of-web-traffic-is-not-human/282309/">bots (search engines, etc.), not human, "view" half</a> these ads. Another quarter are <a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/amount-questionable-online-traffic-will-blow-your-mind-153083">fraud</a>, in its <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-1-how-monetizing-became-malvertising">many forms</a>. And 15% broken ads that never display at all. 

So, 85 percent of paid-for impresssions are either bogus, broken, or bot-hits. Reid Tatoris, Co-Founder of <a href="http://areyouahuman.com/">Are You a Human?</a>, breaks down the remainder:
<blockquote>
<p>We start with the notion that only 15% of impressions ever have the possibility to be seen by a real person. Then, factor in that <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Blog/Viewability_Benchmarks_Show_Many_Ads_Are_Not_In-View_but_Rates_Vary_by_Publisher">54% of ads are not viewable</a> (and we already discussed how flawed that metric is), and you’re left with <em>only 8% of impressions that have the opportunity to be seen by a real person</em>. Let me clarify: that does not mean that 8% of impressions are seen. That means only 8% have the chance to be seen. That’s an unbelievable amount of waste in an industry where metrics are a major selling point.</p>

Not only can't big-data-driven ads target specific populations, most of the time ad tech can't even find a single person. That can be good thing.

When Google's big data botched ad buys for Citigroup, IBM and Microsoft, the Finacial Times headline read <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwiR4uW9t-nOAhUU0WMKHWbJAfMQFggeMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2Fb06d18c0-1bfb-11e6-8fa5-44094f6d9c46.html&usg=AFQjCNHQ9c1XxyOrZGi_JjmpWfIJR1l3_A&sig2=DRKy3VsUTXevRYsimr50PA">"Jihadi website with beheadings profited from Google ad platform."</a>.

Not only is ad tech cluttering up people's screens with ads that are designed to deliver accidental clicks that are near-impossible to avoid, those ads come with scripts to turn your user behavior into their big data -- and those scripts have significant bandwidth attached. In other words, a very significant chunk of your data plan, battery life and time waiting for sites to load are costs you pay to watch the very same ads that are messing up your customer experience.

<h2>Vitaman $ deficiency</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>As a result, online advertising efficiency has been decreasing for years, and companies have to spend more ad dollars for the same result. The process of ad placement has become ever more automated, obscure and complex, while intermediaries have multiplied, each taking a cut from the client's initial ad budget. Controls and regulations are nonexistent, and a big chunk of ad spending is being stolen, plain and simple.</p>

<p>Websites have been invaded by click ads, display ads, and forced video ad views. Naturally, Internet users have grown sick and tired of this ad pollution, and have started installing ad blocking software. What makes this trend worse is that users who install ad blockers first, tend to be the more sophisticated and the more affluent ones</p>

<h2>The wrong advertising</h2>

David Ogilvy, the OG of Mad Men:
<blockquote>
<p>The wrong advertising can actually reduce the sales of a product. I am told that George Hay Brown, at one time head of marketing research at Ford, inserted advertisements in every other copy of the Reader's Digest. At the end of the year, the people who had not been exposed to the advertising had bought more Fords than those who had.</p>

<p>In another survey it was found that consumption of a certain brand of beer was lower among people who remembered its advertising than those who did not. The brewer had spent millions of dollars on advertising which un-sold his beer.</p>

<p>I sometimes wonder if there is a tacit conspiracy among clients, media and agencies to avoid putting advertising to such acid tests. Everyone involved has a vested interest in prolonging the myth that all advertising increases sales to some degree. It doesn't.</p>

<h2>Addicted to big data</h2>
Ad tech companies lose money. The only way they exist and survive is convincing investors that someday their scheme will prove pofitable. 
Maciej Cegłowski calls this "investor storytime":
<blockquote>
<p>Investor storytime is not exactly advertising, but it is related to advertising. Think of it as an advertising future, or perhaps the world's most targeted ad.</p>

<p>Both business models involve persuasion. In one of them, you're asking millions of listeners to hand over a little bit of money. In the other, you're persuading one or two listeners to hand over millions of money.</p>

<p>I like to think of the quote from King Lear:  
	I will do such things,—  
	What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be  
	The terrors of the earth</p>

<p>That's the essence of investor storytime. Give us money now, and you won't believe how awesome our ads will be when we finally put them on the site.</p>

<p>King Lear would have killed it in Silicon Valley...</p>

<p>We're addicted to 'big data' not because it's effective now, but because we need it to tell better stories.</p>

Am I being too harsh?

The fairy tale is that Big Data and high-tech can target ads tospecific groups of people. The reality is they mostly can't even get the ad to a person, any person. All most programmatically targeted ads hits is just another computer program. 

policy of pissing off readers.

addicted to analytics. Maybe it's CYA, maybe they're bedazzled by spreadsheets. But I think at this point it'd be hard to make the case BigData has sold anything -- other than itself -- to anyone. And it'd be easy to show how the side effects of BigData is killing the adverstising and news inductries.

<em>iMore</em>, the Apple news site, on "The Black Box":
<blockquote>
<p>Each ad gets its own iframe, so load is asynchronous and, if one fails, it doesn't kill the entire site. Unfortunately, that also means each one fires its own trackers, even if those trackers are identical across ads. It's terribly inefficient…</p>

<p>Just as desktop ads pay far less than old-fashioned print ads, mobile ads pay far less than desktop. Because phone displays are smaller than desktop, ads are also far harder to ignore. They're not off to the side or a small strip on a big screen. They're in our faces and in our way…</p>

<p>You'd think the ad industry would be at the forefront of user experience, and that making gorgeous, high performance, highly engaging ads would boost conversion and ultimately income for everyone. Unfortunately, it seems like whatever math they're running shows bad ads perform well enough that making great ads isn't worth the extra effort.</p>

Say you want to target your ad to brogrammers running ad-tech rackets. You simply puchase a steaming pile of Big Data that cross-tabs chronic Disrupt attendees with dailt tweeters with frequent Ferrari web visitors. Instantly half the phones in Palo Alto light up with your product.

It doesn't always work this way, though, and by "not always" I mean "almost never."
