<h1>Breaking News 2: When Good Ads Go Bad</h1>

<em><strong>Breaking News</strong> is a series on the self-inflicted fractures breaking the news business. The first was <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-1-how-monetizing-became-malvertising">on malvertising</a>. This second report is on the "ad tech tax" everyone pays, in dollars, time and readership.</em>

<blockquote>
I can think of nothing that has done more harm to the Internet than ad tech. It interferes with everything we try to do on the Web. It has cheapened and debased advertising and spawned criminal empires. 
<div><cite>&mdash;Bob Hoffman (<a href="http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/">The Ad Contrarian</a>) quoted by <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-click-fraud/"><em>Bloomberg Business</em></a></cite></div>

My 93-year-old mom called the other day, almost in tears. Her browser had been taken over by popups that re-popped up every time she closed them. The slimy site (that she'd clicked to from RealClearPolitics) and its putrid popups persisted even after quitting and relaunching the browser. My mother was another victim of modern advertising.

<h2>Old hotness, new and busted</h2>

<img align="right" width="400" src="https://github.com/hearvox/breaking-news/blob/master/assets/ad-plymouth.jpg?raw=true">Once upon a time, an advertiser contracted a media agency to place specific advertisements in specific publications. Publishers provided "tear sheets" proving the ads had run. The agency got 15% of ad's cost; the publishers pocketed the rest.

This type of advertising built the brands of nearly every major product you've ever heard of. So, obviously, the entire industry needed radical disruption.

Legions of brogrammers began innovating advertising technologies, claiming to: "Build, run, measure and optimize retargeting-driven display campaigns." "Deliver cohesive messaging to qualified consumers at scale." "Analyze first-party premium publisher site level data to pinpoint active consumer intent." (All real company slogans, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=YCMTSU">YCMTSU</a>.) Mainly what they did, though, was radically raise their rates.

The old 15% cut for media agencies has creeped up to <a href="http://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Programmatic-Value-Layers-March-2016-FINALv2.pdf">55% in 2014</a>. In 2015, the creeps <a href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/270487/study-finds-only-40-of-digital-buys-going-to-work.html">took 60%</a>.

<h2>The ad tech tax</h2>

<blockquote>
A user clicks on a website and suddenly her Internet address and browsing history are packaged and whisked off to an auction site, where software, on behalf of advertisers, scrutinizes her profile (or an anonymized version of it) and determines whether to bid to place an ad next to that article. Ford Motor could pay to put its ads on websites for car buffs, or, with the help of cookies, track car buffs wherever they may be online. Ford might want to target males age 25-40 for pickup-truck ads, or, better yet, anybody in that age group who’s even read about pickups in the past six months.

"Ad tech" is the new automated way we buy, sell, deliver, and display online advertising. The "ad tech tax" is the cost of this convoluted complexity.

Good luck following this <a href="http://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Programmatic-Value-Layers-March-2016-FINALv2.pdf">Interactive Advertising Bureau chart</a> of a typical ad buy:  

<img src="https://github.com/hearvox/breaking-news/blob/master/assets/IAB-Programmatic-CPM.png?raw=true" />  
<em><a href="http://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Programmatic-Value-Layers-March-2016-FINALv2.pdf">Anatomy of a Programmatic CPM</a> (CPM = cost per thousand impressions; DSP, SSP and DMP = platforms: demand-side, sell-side and data management)</em>

<h2>Making a bad impression</h2>

Ad tech bills advertisers by the "impression," a semi-mythical event, said to occur (by the <a href="http://measurementnow.net/press-release-media-rating-council-updates-viewable-ad-impression-measurement-guidelines/#.V5ELiZMrLOZ">Media Rating Council</a>) when half an advert's pixels are "in view" for one continuous second — two seconds for video ads.

But only <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/welcome-to-the-internet-of-thingies-615-of-web-traffic-is-not-human/282309/">bots "view" half these ads</a> (search engines, etc.; i.e., not humans). Another <a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/amount-questionable-online-traffic-will-blow-your-mind-153083">quarter are fraud</a>, in its <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-1-how-monetizing-became-malvertising">many forms</a>. And 15% are broken ads that never display at all. 

So, 85 percent of paid-for impressions are either bogus, broken, or bot-hits. Reid Tatoris, Co-Founder of <a href="http://areyouahuman.com/">Are You a Human?</a>, breaks down the remainder:
<blockquote>
<p>We start with the notion that only 15% of impressions ever have the possibility to be seen by a real person. Then, factor in that <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Blog/Viewability_Benchmarks_Show_Many_Ads_Are_Not_In-View_but_Rates_Vary_by_Publisher">54% of ads are not viewable</a> (and we already discussed how flawed that metric is), and you’re left with <em>only 8% of impressions that have the opportunity to be seen by a real person</em>. Let me clarify: that does not mean that 8% of impressions are seen. That means only 8% have the chance to be seen. That’s an unbelievable amount of waste in an industry where metrics are a major selling point.</p>

Ad tech fails in targeting specific people. It even fails in finding any person, or, worse, finds the wrong people.

After a botched buy for Citigroup, IBM and Microsoft, the Financial Times headline read <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwiR4uW9t-nOAhUU0WMKHWbJAfMQFggeMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2Fb06d18c0-1bfb-11e6-8fa5-44094f6d9c46.html&usg=AFQjCNHQ9c1XxyOrZGi_JjmpWfIJR1l3_A&sig2=DRKy3VsUTXevRYsimr50PA">"Jihadi website with beheadings profited from Google ad platform."</a> FT's video explains:

Ad-blocked the page weight was 938 KB. Unblocked it's 10.3 MB, more than 11-times larger.

Ad tech is ravenous for data, for your data. We sacrifice our patience (waiting for webpages), our privacy and our pocketbooks (cellphone plans) so ad tech can gorge on our private parts. 

<blockquote>
<p>Each ad gets its own iframe, so load is asynchronous and, if one fails, it doesn't kill the entire site. Unfortunately, that also means each one fires its own trackers, even if those trackers are identical across ads. It's terribly inefficient</p>

<p>We've tried to find or figure out a way to streamline them, but haven't been able to. They're built into the foundations of all the major networks, ad and social, ostensibly to provide more "relevant" content.</p>

It gets worse: Ad-tech and social-site tracking combined can now individually identify who you are, who your friends are, and what you and they do online. Anonymity is antiquated, read and weep: <a href="http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2009/workshops/wosn/papers/p7.pdf
">"On the Leakage of Personally Identifiable Information Via Online Social Networks"</a>, by AT&T Labs and Worcester Polytechnic Institute researchers.

Stuffing all these scripts down our browser's throats is choking online news. My RJI research data on <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/need-for-speed-1-newspaper-load-times-give-slow-news-day-new-meaning">the (poor) performance of U.S. newspaper websites</a> showed scripts were 56 percent of the page-weight and 35 percent of the file-requests — the two factors most correlated with page-load times. The New York Times examined 50 news sites and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/01/business/cost-of-mobile-ads.html">"found more than half of all data came from ads and other content filtered by ad blockers."</a>

Ad tracking pisses people off. Ad stalking creeps people out:
<blockquote>
<p>How annoying are each of the following mobile ads?
<ol>
<li>Ads that popup over my entire screen: 73%</li>
<li>Ads that seem to "follow" me from my computer to my phone: 65%</li>

<div><cite>&mdash;<a href="https://www.neustar.biz/resources/whitepapers/digital-brands-trust-report">"What erodes trust in digital brands?"</a> <em>Neustar</em> survey</cite></div></p>
</blockquote>

Two-thirds of Neustar's respondents checked: "I do not trust websites that take too long to load: 67%" in a list of "Perceptions about trustworthy newssites." (Grammarians, rejoice, the #1 choice was "I do not trust websites that contain errors or mistakes: 91%".)

<h2>Ad targeting: bullseye or bullshit?</h2>
All these precision-targeted, big-data-driven ads have sales soaring, right? Wrong.

Online advertising efficiency is in a nosedive. This <a href="https://kalkis-research.com/clickbait-and-traffic-laundering-how-ad-tech-is-destroying-the-web">Kalkis Research</a> chart shows the plunging ratio of revenue dollars to dollars spent on digital marketing:

<p><img src="https://kalkis-research.com/imagecache/8ebb0582bdbaa85c4dc2fcf662bfccde.png">
<div><em>Dollars of revenue for every dollar spent on digital marketing, average for Amazon, Priceline, Booking.com, Expedia and eBay (source: SEC 10-K filings 2010 through 2015, <a href="https://kalkis-research.com/clickbait-and-traffic-laundering-how-ad-tech-is-destroying-the-web">Kalkis Research</a>)</em></div></p>

When eBay tested ad tech by turning off search ads in half the U.S. cities, sales <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/10/the-online-ad-scams-every-marketer-should-watch-out-for">"stayed the same even as eBay’s advertising expenditure dropped."</a> When Procter & Gamble <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/p-g-to-scale-back-targeted-facebook-ads-1470760949">targeted Fabreze (an air freshener) ads</a> at pet owners and large-family households, sales stayed flat. When, instead, they sent the ads to anyone over 18, sales rose.

The only thing online advertising sells well is ad blockers, which Doc Searls calls <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/09/28/beyond-ad-blocking-the-biggest-boycott-in-human-history/">"the biggest boycott in history."</a>

<blockquote>
<p>Online advertising efficiency has been decreasing for years, and companies have to spend more ad dollars for the same result. The process of ad placement has become ever more automated, obscure and complex, while intermediaries have multiplied, each taking a cut from the client's initial ad budget. Controls and regulations are nonexistent, and a big chunk of ad spending is being stolen, plain and simple.</p>

<p>Websites have been invaded by click ads, display ads, and forced video ad views. Naturally, Internet users have grown sick and tired of this ad pollution, and have started installing ad blocking software. What makes this trend worse is that users who install ad blockers first, tend to be the more sophisticated and the more affluent ones</p>

<h2>Addicted to big data</h2>
<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/ad-tech-growth-hits-speed-bump-1451936427
">Ad tech companies aren't profitable</a> yet they grow like weeds. In 2011 there were 150; now, in 2016, <a href="http://chiefmartec.com/2016/03/marketing-technology-landscape-supergraphic-2016/">there are 3,500</a>. They breed and feed on big data, claiming it will someday, somehow translate into sales.

Maciej Cegłowski, of Pinboard, says their real goal isn't CPM, it's VC — "Investor Storytime":
<blockquote>
<p>Investor storytime is not exactly advertising, but it is related to advertising. Think of it as an advertising future, or perhaps the world's most targeted ad.</p>

<p>Both business models involve persuasion. In one of them, you're asking millions of listeners to hand over a little bit of money. In the other, you're persuading one or two listeners to hand over millions of money.</p>

<p>That's the essence of investor storytime. Give us money now, and you won't believe how awesome our ads will be when we finally put them on the site.</p>

<p>We're addicted to 'big data' not because it's effective now, but because we need it to tell better stories.</p>

<h2>The wrong advertising</h2>

I've yet to mention <a href="http://www.trademob.com/pressrelease/40-percent-of-mobile-ad-clicks-are-fraudulent-or-accidental-according-to-new-study-by-trademob/">near-zero click-through rates</a>, <a href="http://adage.com/article/agency-news/media-agency-kickbacks-real/297707/">ad agency kickbacks</a>, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-07/high-speed-ad-traders-profit-by-arbitraging-your-eyeballs">high-frequency price pumping</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/03/are-bots-hijacking-your-marketing-budget/">non-human trafficking</a> and <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-1-how-monetizing-became-malvertising">malvertising ransomeware</a>. But I think you've heard enough. (Consult <a href="http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/">The Ad Contrarian</a> for all the hows and whys of ad-tech failures.)

We web publishers could chose to end this madness, by <a href="https://wpostats.com/">prioritizing speed</a> and security on our sites, supporting the <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/privacy">privacy projects</a> and collaborating on open-source, performant tracking and ad-delivery scripts — with opt-ins and data storage expiration dates (read Cegłowski's <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/haunted_by_data.htm">"Haunted by Data"</a>). Our readers would love us for it, and advertisers can't resist loving readers.

For now, though, I'll leave you with this 1983 thought from David Ogilvy, the OG of Mad Men:
<blockquote>
<p>The wrong advertising can actually reduce the sales of a product. I am told that George Hay Brown, at one time head of marketing research at Ford, inserted advertisements in every other copy of the Reader's Digest. At the end of the year, the people who had not been exposed to the advertising had bought more Fords than those who had.</p>

<p>In another survey it was found that consumption of a certain brand of beer was lower among people who remembered its advertising than those who did not. The brewer had spent millions of dollars on advertising which un-sold his beer.</p>

<p>I sometimes wonder if there is a tacit conspiracy among clients, media and agencies to avoid putting advertising to such acid tests. Everyone involved has a vested interest in prolonging the myth that all advertising increases sales to some degree. It doesn't.</p>
