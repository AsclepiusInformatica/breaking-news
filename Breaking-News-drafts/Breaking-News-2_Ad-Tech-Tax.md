<h1>Breaking News 2: Ad Tech Tax — Goods Ads Gone Bad</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>I can think of nothing that has done more harm to the Internet than ad tech. It interferes with everything we try to do on the Web. It has cheapened and debased advertising and spawned criminal empires.</p>

My 93-year-old mom called the other day, almost in tears. Her browser had been taken over. She'd clicked a link at RealClearPolitics to a site which mercilessly launched and re-launched popup windows not matter how many times she closed them. The slimy site and its putrid popups persisted even after quitting and re-opening the bbrowser. My mom had become another victim of modern advertising.

<h2>Old hotness, new and busted</h2>

<img align="right" width="400" src="https://github.com/hearvox/breaking-news/blob/master/assets/ad-plymouth.jpg?raw=true">Once upon a time, an advertiser contracted a media agency to place specific advertisments in specific publications. Publishers provided "tear sheets" proving the ads had run. The agency got 15% of ad's cost; the publishers pocketed the rest.

This type of advertising built the brands of nearly every major product and service you've ever heard of. So, obviously, the whole process was in need of radical disruption.

Legions of millenials began innovating advertising technologies. They strategically leveraged social media data. They impacted highly engaged conversations. And they radically raised their rates.

The old 15% cut for media agencies has creeped up to <a href="http://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Programmatic-Value-Layers-March-2016-FINALv2.pdf">55% in 2014</a>. In 2015, the creeps <a href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/270487/study-finds-only-40-of-digital-buys-going-to-work.html">took 60%</a>. It costs money for brands to butt into all those strategically impacted conversations.

"Ad tech" is the new automated way we now buy, sell, deliver, and display online advertising. The surcharge for this data-driven automation is the "ad tech tax."

<h2>Ad targetting: bullseye or bullshit?</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>When you open a web page, information such as age, sex, location and search history are zapped to buyers vying for your attention. Bundled with 999 other people, those eyeballs are offered to the highest bidder, usually ad agencies and their clients, which can range from big public companies such as Apple Inc. to local car dealerships.</p>

Say you want your ad to target brogrammers running a questionable ad-tech racket. You simply puchase a steaming pile of Big Data that cross-tabs latte addicts who frequent Ferrari's website with chronic Disrupt attendees. Instantly half the phonmes on the Google bus light up with your product.

It doesn't always work this way, though, and by "not always" I mean "almost never."

<h2>Making a bad impression</h2>

Ad tech bills advertisers by the "impression," a semi-mythical event hypothesized, by the <a href="http://measurementnow.net/press-release-media-rating-council-updates-viewable-ad-impression-measurement-guidelines/#.V5ELiZMrLOZ">Media Rating Council</a>, to occur when half an advert's pixels are "in view" for one continuous second (two seconds for video ads).

But it's <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/welcome-to-the-internet-of-thingies-615-of-web-traffic-is-not-human/282309/">bots</a> (search engines, etc.) that "view" half</a> these ads, not humans. Another quarter are of these paid-for impresssions are <a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/amount-questionable-online-traffic-will-blow-your-mind-153083">fraudulent ads</a>, in its <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-1-how-monetizing-became-malvertising">myriad forms</a>. And 15% the ads are broken -- they never display at all. 

So, 85 percent of paid-for impresssions are fraud, broken, or bot-hits. Reid Tatoris, Co-Founder of <a href="http://areyouahuman.com/">Are You a Human?</a>, breaks down the remainder:
<blockquote>
<p>We start with the notion that only 15% of impressions ever have the possibility to be seen by a real person. Then, factor in that <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Blog/Viewability_Benchmarks_Show_Many_Ads_Are_Not_In-View_but_Rates_Vary_by_Publisher">54% of ads are not viewable</a> (and we already discussed how flawed that metric is), and you’re left with <em>only 8% of impressions that have the opportunity to be seen by a real person</em>. Let me clarify: that does not mean that 8% of impressions are seen. That means only 8% have the chance to be seen. That’s an unbelievable amount of waste in an industry where metrics are a major selling point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not only is ad tech cluttering up people's screens with ads that are designed to deliver accidental clicks that are near-impossible to avoid, those ads come with scripts to turn your user behavior into their big data -- and those scripts have significant bandwidth attached. In other words, a very significant chunk of your data plan, battery life and time waiting for sites to load are costs you pay to watch the very same ads that are messing up your customer experience.</p>

<h2>When good ads go bad</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The wrong advertising can actually reduce the sales of a product. I am told that George Hay Brown, at one time head of marketing research at Ford, inserted advertisements in every other copy of the Reader's Digest. At the end of the year, the people who had not been exposed to the advertising had bought more Fords than those who had.</p>

<p>In another survey it was found that consumption of a certain brand of beer was lower among people who remembered its advertising than those who did not. The brewer had spent millions of dollars on advertising which un-sold his beer.</p>

<p>I sometimes wonder if there is a tacit conspiracy among clients, media and agencies to avoid putting advertising to such acid tests. Everyone involved has a vested interest in prolonging the myth that all advertising increases sales to some degree. It doesn't.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a result, online advertising efficiency has been decreasing for years, and companies have to spend more ad dollars for the same result. The process of ad placement has become ever more automated, obscure and complex, while intermediaries have multiplied, each taking a cut from the client's initial ad budget. Controls and regulations are nonexistent, and a big chunk of ad spending is being stolen, plain and simple.</p>

<p>Websites have been invaded by click ads, display ads, and forced video ad views. Naturally, Internet users have grown sick and tired of this ad pollution, and have started installing ad blocking software. What makes this trend worse is that users who install ad blockers first, tend to be the more sophisticated and the more affluent ones</p>

<h2>The superstitious belief in big data</h2>
Ad tech companies lose money. The only way they exist and survive is convincing investors that someday their scheme will prove pofitable. 
Maciej Cegłowski calls this "investor storytime":
<blockquote>
<p>Investor storytime is not exactly advertising, but it is related to advertising. Think of it as an advertising future, or perhaps the world's most targeted ad.</p>

<p>Both business models involve persuasion. In one of them, you're asking millions of listeners to hand over a little bit of money. In the other, you're persuading one or two listeners to hand over millions of money.</p>

<p>I like to think of the quote from King Lear:  
	I will do such things,—  
	What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be  
	The terrors of the earth</p>

<p>That's the essence of investor storytime. Give us money now, and you won't believe how awesome our ads will be when we finally put them on the site.</p>

<p>King Lear would have killed it in Silicon Valley...</p>

<p>We're addicted to 'big data' not because it's effective now, but because we need it to tell better stories.</p>

Am I being too harsh? If so, to be nicer to the ad tech folks, I won't even mention <a href="http://adage.com/article/agency-news/media-agency-kickbacks-real/297707/">their kickbacks</a>, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-07/high-speed-ad-traders-profit-by-arbitraging-your-eyeballs">high-freq price pumping</a>, and  <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-click-fraud/">non-human trafficking</a>.

The fairy tale is that Big Data and high-tech can target ads tospecific groups of people. The reality is they mostly can't even get the ad to a person, any person. All most programmatically targeted ads hits is just another computer program. 

policy of pissing off readers.

addicted to analytics. Maybe it's CYA, maybe they're bedazzled by spreadsheets. But I think at this point it'd be hard to make the case BigData has sold anything -- other than itself -- to anyone. And it'd be easy to show how the side effects of BigData is killing the adverstising and news inductries. 

<blockquote>
<p>A user clicks on a website and suddenly her Internet address and browsing history are packaged and whisked off to an auction site, where software, on behalf of advertisers, scrutinizes her profile (or an anonymized version of it) and determines whether to bid to place an ad next to that article. Ford Motor could pay to put its ads on websites for car buffs, or, with the help of cookies, track car buffs wherever they may be online. Ford might want to target males age 25-40 for pickup-truck ads, or, better yet, anybody in that age group who’s even read about pickups in the past six months.</p>

<em>iMore</em>, the Apple news site, on "The Black Box":
<blockquote>
<p>Each ad gets its own iframe, so load is asynchronous and, if one fails, it doesn't kill the entire site. Unfortunately, that also means each one fires its own trackers, even if those trackers are identical across ads. It's terribly inefficient…</p>

<p>Just as desktop ads pay far less than old-fashioned print ads, mobile ads pay far less than desktop. Because phone displays are smaller than desktop, ads are also far harder to ignore. They're not off to the side or a small strip on a big screen. They're in our faces and in our way…</p>

<p>You'd think the ad industry would be at the forefront of user experience, and that making gorgeous, high performance, highly engaging ads would boost conversion and ultimately income for everyone. Unfortunately, it seems like whatever math they're running shows bad ads perform well enough that making great ads isn't worth the extra effort.</p>
