<h1>Breaking News 3: New Media Myths</h1>

<em><strong>Breaking News</strong> is about the self-inflicted fractures breaking the news business. Previous posts were on <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-1-how-monetizing-became-malvertising">on malvertising</a> and the <a href=https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-2-when-good-ads-go-bad>ad tech tax</a>.</em>

We often become what we believe. In the news industry we have come to believe a lot of bunk. Below is the math that explodes these myths.

<h2>Myth: People won't pay for content</h2>

The good news: Online ads on newspaper sites make money, a lot of money.

The bad news: Mobile phone carriers pocket most of that money, not news publishers.

A U.S. reader pays a cell provider $0.30 in data plan fees to download the average newspaper webpage -- $0.46 if she has a prepaid plan. A news site, on a good day, might get $0.03 for every ad that reader sees.   

The math comes from the <a href="https://whatdoesmysitecost.com/">What Does My Site Cost?</a> calculator. Enter a URL "to find out how much it costs for someone to use your site on mobile networks around the world." The greater the page-weight the greater the cost. Newpaper webpages average <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/need-for-speed-1-newspaper-load-times-give-slow-news-day-new-meaning">a staggering heavy 4.7 MB</a>, more than double the web-average, making it expensive for readers to download.

For the same page-view, telcos often rake in many times more in data fees than publishers do in ads. Plus, publishers funnel billions in ad dollars to social and search sites, with questionable ROI. News content makes plenty in profit, just not for news sites. 

<h2>Myth: The internet is killing newspapers</h2>

The decline in both the <a href="http://www.journalism.org/numbers/number-of-u-s-daily-newspapers-5-year-increments/">number of newspapers</a> and in <a href="http://media-cmi.com/downloads/Sixty_Years_Daily_Newspaper_Circulation_Trends_050611.pdf">paid circulation</a> started in the 1950s.  Since their lows in 2009, newspapers have had upticks in both their <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2016/06/15/newspapers-fact-sheet/#audience">circulation</a> and <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2016/06/15/newspapers-fact-sheet/#economics">advertising revenue</a>. So don't blame social media mania or the interwebs for ailments in the news biz.

New medium often augment but rarely replace the old. The century-old media of radio and movies still flourish and live theatre has lasted for millenia.

Legacy media ain't dead yet: <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/heres-how-americans-spend-their-working-relaxing-and-parenting-time/">"Americans still spend more time watching TV than all other leisure activities combined"</a>. Half the people <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2016/06/15/newspapers-fact-sheet/#audience">"who consume a newspaper read it exclusively in print"</a> (just five percent read it desktop or mobile only; seven percent on both mobile and desktop), And <a href="http://www.wan-ifra.org/press-releases/2015/06/01/world-press-trends-newspaper-revenues-shift-to-new-sources">"globally, more than 93 per cent of all newspaper revenues still come from print."</a>

<h2>Myth: New media makes money</h2>

'Sides Facebook, the sites you list all lose money, many millions annually.

These social-site service on vampiric practices. They suck the content of newspapers and musicians, drool back a little traffic, but feed on all the ad revenue.

Should you'd hire an investigative reporter or a social media strategist? A trick question, because that choice has already been made, over and over, by most newspapers. They haven't add more reporters -- i.e., the source of all their readership. No, they've picked social media as their new focus, in essence, contributing money to their competitors.
