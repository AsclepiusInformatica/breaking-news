<h1>Breaking News 3: New Media Myths</h1>

<em><strong>Breaking News</strong> is about the self-inflicted fractures breaking the news business. Previous posts were on <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-1-how-monetizing-became-malvertising">on malvertising</a> and the <a href=https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-2-when-good-ads-go-bad>ad tech tax</a>.</em>

Below is the fiscal math that explodes the myths we in the news industry believe.

<h2>Myth: People won't pay for content</h2>

The good news: Newspaper websites makes money, lots of money.

The bad news: News publishers don't get most of that money. It goes to cell phone carriers, ad-tech agencies, search and social sites.

Slow webpages are expensive for mobile users. Newspaper webpages are annoyingly slow, <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/need-for-speed-1-newspaper-load-times-give-slow-news-day-new-meaning">averaging 17-second page-loads and 4.7 MB page-weights</a>. Based on the <a href="https://whatdoesmysitecost.com/">What Does My Site Cost?</a> calculator, a U.S. reader $0.30 in data plan fees -- $0.46 for prepaid plans -- to look at the average news page.

That page has ads, for which the publisher gets a few pennies. But the most of the ad dollars go to the <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-2-when-good-ads-go-bad">ad-tech tax</a>. Hamish Nicklin, chief revenue officer of <a href="http://mediatel.co.uk/newsline/2016/10/04/where-did-the-money-go-guardian-buys-its-own-ad-inventory">The Guardian, found</a> "a host of adtech businesses are extracting up to 70% of advertisers' money without being able to quantify the value they provide to the brand.

"There are so many different players taking a little cut here, a little cut there -- and sometimes a very big cut. A lot of the money that [advertisers] think they are giving to premium publishers is not actually getting to us."

Another hand reaching into newpaper's pockets is the digital duopoly of Google and Facebook, whose success depends on excerpting news articles. They raked in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-22/google-and-facebook-lead-digital-ad-industry-to-revenue-record">64 percent of 2015's $60 billion in online ad revenue</a>.

Newspapers, magazines and other publishers are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/29/publishers-facebook-bloomberg-media-justin-smith-ads">"feeding on [Facebook's] scraps,"</a> says Bloomberg Media's Justin Smith. "They keep the $16bn to $18bn they get in the news feed, and the news feed, with personal sharing down, is effectively just an aggregation of premium publishers' content."

<blockquote>
Online publishers have a dumbass business model and do not get any part of this revenue.

<h2>Myth: The internet is killing newspapers</h2>

The decline in both the <a href="http://www.journalism.org/numbers/number-of-u-s-daily-newspapers-5-year-increments/">number of newspapers</a> and in <a href="http://media-cmi.com/downloads/Sixty_Years_Daily_Newspaper_Circulation_Trends_050611.pdf">paid circulation</a> started in the 1950s, well before the internet.

<img src="https://github.com/hearvox/breaking-news/blob/master/assets/circulation-1950‐2010.png?raw=true" alt="Chart: Newspaper circulation 1950-2010" />  

Newspapers hit <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2016/06/15/newspapers-fact-sheet/#audience">circulation</a> and <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2016/06/15/newspapers-fact-sheet/#economics">advertising revenue</a> lows in 2009, but have upticked since then, simultaneous with the growth of social sites. So don't blame the interwebs or social media for ailments in the news biz.

New media rarely replace the old. Television didn't kill movies. Movies didn't kill live theatre. (Think theatre is dead? Try gettting tickets to this weekend's "Hamilton".)

Legacy media is doing fine: <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/heres-how-americans-spend-their-working-relaxing-and-parenting-time/">quoting FiveThirtyEight</a>, "Americans still spend more time watching TV than all other leisure activities combined." The <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2016/06/15/newspapers-fact-sheet/#js-chart-55574">Pew Research Center reports</a> more than half the people "who consume a newspaper read it exclusively in print" (just 12 percent are online-only news readers). In a <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/lifestyle/general_lifestyle/april_2012/66_prefer_reading_print_newspaper_to_online_version">Rasmussen Reports survey</a>, "Sixty-six percent (66%) of American Adults say they prefer reading a printed version of the newspaper." And the <a href="http://www.wan-ifra.org/press-releases/2015/06/01/world-press-trends-newspaper-revenues-shift-to-new-sources">World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers calculates</a>, "globally, more than 93 per cent of all newspaper revenues still come from print."

<blockquote>
Results indicated that the (supposedly dying) print product still reaches far more readers than the (supposedly promising) digital product in these newspapers’ home markets, and this holds true across all age groups.

<h2>Myth: New media makes money</h2>

Most <a href="http://www.poynter.org/2015/a-hidden-success-story-for-newspaper-circulation-costs-are-down-and-revenues-are-up/362687/">newspapers are profitable</a>. But, except for Facebook, almost all social and online-only news sites bleed money. Their net income lines looks like crime scenes, covered in red.

New media companies dont make profit, they make pitchdecks. Their cash from comes convincing investors in fairy-tale futures -- <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/internet_with_a_human_face.htm">"Investor Storytime,"</a> in the words of Pinboard CEO Maciej Cegłowski:

<blockquote>
Investor storytime is not exactly advertising, but it is related to advertising. Think of it as an advertising future, or perhaps the world's most targeted ad.

Both business models involve persuasion. In one of them, you're asking millions of listeners to hand over a little bit of money. In the other, you're persuading one or two listeners to hand over millions of money.

</blockquote>

Newspapers are competing against companies that lose money, while media pundits tell the papers to mimic these money-losers.

This is also a pre-web phenomenon. In the early 80s, USA Today premiered a paper with more color and articles with less words. Publishers panicked. Surely doom would befall any who didn't adopt the upstart's approach. Turned out to be a false alarm, though: <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Gannett_Co._Inc.aspx">USA Today never had profitable year<a/>. 

When someone insists news needs to be more social, more millenial, more [insert buzzword-du-jour here], I say: Show me the <abbr title="Return on investment">ROI</abbr>.

<h2>Myth: We need to disrupt ourselves</h2>
I do wish the journalism industry would <a href="http://scottberkun.com/2008/stop-saying-innovation-heres-why/">stop chanting</a> "disruption" and "innovation" because neither are really <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/innovation-is-overvalued-maintenance-often-matters-more">how technologies progress</a>.

"Disruptive innovation" <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/23/the-disruption-machine">is a discredited hypothesis</a> that doesn't <a href="http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-useful-is-the-theory-of-disruptive-innovation/">explain or predict anything</a>.

<blockquote>
The prediction of the theory would be that Apple won't succeed with the iPhone. It's not [truly] disruptive. History speaks pretty loudly on that.

True disruption has disasterous results, from climate change and species extinction to these children scavenging in a landfill on fire (photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/adamcohn/24901541891/in/photolist-DUhdHY-E5HeoP-9Ytvwz-DCBuvq-E3pxaj-D8194b-E5GLce-D8jpvr-DWtYAc-DUhDcs-DWsURa-4MLTT1-E3otQW-D8kRCV-DCBNEm-DUi9vs-DCB6qN-E3o7uj-E3pALs-E5HwLV-DwfjhB-Dwe5V8-DweH4a-D7ZD2J-DCAjwj-DUiJAw-E3oWyf-DCBj4J-DCAfNN-4MGH1e-D8k2D8-D8jbte-ppMcqj-paj26T-paj2dM-paj1Xg-nsQHE-5gM31S-pakfWz-pajmvf-vv5m4B-6N15SY-zwtcC-jnZom-paj1T8-yTzzhA-yVncpZ-yVn68v-cq5TLh-aQtVEx">Adam Cohn</a>):

When I look at the online news industry, all I see is disruption:
<ul>
<li>A disrupted reader experience, interrupting, obstructing and diverting the <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/how-to-make-online-news-brain-friendly">reading path</a>.</li>
<li>A disrupted news delivery system, with painfully slow page-loads, bloated by widgets, often <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-1-how-monetizing-became-malvertising">loaded with malware</a>.</li>
<li>A disrupted business model, which lets social sites, cell phone providers and ad agencies siphon its revenue.</li>
<li>A disrupted mission, chasing fads and Facebook likes instead of checking facts and informing the public.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>If you look at feedback loops like likes and retweets, they’ve been very carefully crafted to maximise certain types of behaviours. But if we reward people based on a measurement system where there’s literally no difference between a one-second page view or reading something that brought them value or changed their mind, it’s like — your job is feeding people, but all you’re measuring is maximising calorie delivery.</p>

We’re still stuck in some very naive thinking, with the idea that people consuming media means that’s what they want — it’s like, well, we put junk food in front of them and they ate that, so that must be what they want.

<blockquote>
<p>What if, in the mad dash two decades ago to repurpose and extend editorial content onto the Web, editors and publishers made a colossal business blunder that wasted hundreds of millions of dollars? What if the industry should have stuck with its strengths—the print editions where the vast majority of their readers still reside and where the overwhelming majority of advertising and subscription revenue come from—instead of chasing the online chimera?</p>

Conventional newspapers, for all their shortcomings, remain the best source of information about the workings of our government, of industry, and of the major institutions that dominate our lives. They still publish a disproportionate amount of the accountability journalism available, a function that’s not being fully replaced by online newcomers or the nonprofit entities that have popped up. If we give up the print newspaper for dead, accepting its demise without a fight, we stand to lose one of the vital bulwarks that protect and sustain our culture.

These social-site service on vampiric practices. They suck the content of newspapers and musicians, drool back a little traffic, but feed on all the ad revenue.

Should you'd hire an investigative reporter or a social media strategist? A trick question, because that choice has already been made, over and over, by most newspapers. They haven't add more reporters -- i.e., the source of all their readership. No, they've picked social media as their new focus, in essence, contributing money to their competitors.
