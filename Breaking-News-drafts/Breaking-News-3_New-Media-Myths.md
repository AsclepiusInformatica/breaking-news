<h1>Breaking News 3: New Media Myths</h1>

<em><strong>Breaking News</strong> is about the self-inflicted fractures breaking the news business. Previous posts were on <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-1-how-monetizing-became-malvertising">on malvertising</a> and the <a href=https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-2-when-good-ads-go-bad>ad tech tax</a>.</em>

We often become what we believe. In the news industry we have come to believe a lot of bunk, and, as a result, made bad business decisions. Below is the math that explodes these myths.

<h2>Myth: People won't pay for content</h2>

The good news: Online ads on newspaper sites make money, a lot of money.

The bad news: Newspapers don't get that money, mobile phone carriers do, in data plan fees.

To download the average newspaper webpage a U.S. reader pays $0.30 to cell providers ($0.46 for those with prepaid plans). Compare that to the news publishers who, on a really good day, get maybe $0.08 in ad revenue for that same reader-page.

Math: Enter an URL at <a href="https://whatdoesmysitecost.com/">What Does My Site Cost?</a> to calculates "how much it costs for someone to use your site on mobile networks around the world."  

overestimating ad income and underestimating revenue to cell providers.



<h2>Myth: The internet is killing newspapers</h2>

Paid circulation has been steadily declining since the 1950s. Newsroom staff cuts started in the late 80s. Both began well before "online news "existed. So accounting for these declines with "online/web/social-media" explanations is, at best, incomplete (esp. since circulation is up since 2009 -- aka, during the social-media age).

The repost of traditional-media's death are greatly exaggerated:
"51% of those who consume a newspaper read it exclusively in print"

"TV accounts for 95 percent of average video consumption"

"Americans still spend more time watching TV than all other leisure activities combined."

<h2>Myth: New media makes money</h2>

'Sides Facebook, the sites you list all lose money, many millions annually.

<h2>Myth: We need to disrupt ourselves</h2>

These social-site service on vampiric practices. They suck the content of newspapers and musicians, drool back a little traffic, but feed on all the ad revenue.

Should you'd hire an investigative reporter or a social media strategist? A trick question, because that choice has already been made, over and over, by most newspapers. They haven't add more reporters -- i.e., the source of all their readership. No, they've picked social media as their new focus, in essence, contributing money to their competitors.
