<h1>Breaking News 3: New Media Myths</h1>

<em><strong>Breaking News</strong> is about the self-inflicted fractures breaking the news business. Previous posts were on <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-1-how-monetizing-became-malvertising">on malvertising</a> and the <a href=https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-2-when-good-ads-go-bad>ad tech tax</a>.</em>

Below is the math that explodes the myths that we in the news industry believe, and base bad decisions on.

<h2>Myth: People won't pay for content</h2>

The good news: Online ads on newspaper sites make money, a lot of money.

The bad news: News publishers don't get most of that money. Cell phone carriers, ad-tech agnecies, search and social sites do.

Using the <a href="https://whatdoesmysitecost.com/">What Does My Site Cost?</a> calculator, to view the average newspaper webpage, <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/need-for-speed-1-newspaper-load-times-give-slow-news-day-new-meaning">which weighs an obese 4.7 MB</a>, a U.S. reader pays $0.30 in data plan fees -- $0.46 for prepaid plans.

Meanwhile, for every ad the reader views on that page, the newspaper, at best, gets $0.03, while the <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-2-when-good-ads-go-bad">ad-tech agencies can pocket $0.05</a>.

Google and Facebook also rake in profits from excerpting newspaper articles. Online news content generates plenty of revenue, just not for news sites.

<blockquote>
Online publishers have a dumbass business model and do not get any part of this revenue.

<h2>Myth: The internet is killing newspapers</h2>

The decline in both the <a href="http://www.journalism.org/numbers/number-of-u-s-daily-newspapers-5-year-increments/">number of newspapers</a> and in <a href="http://media-cmi.com/downloads/Sixty_Years_Daily_Newspaper_Circulation_Trends_050611.pdf">paid circulation</a> started in the 1950s.

<img src="https://github.com/hearvox/breaking-news/blob/master/assets/circulation-1950‐2010.png?raw=true" alt="Chart: Newspaper circulation 1950-2010" />  

Since their lows in 2009, newspapers have had upticks in both their <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2016/06/15/newspapers-fact-sheet/#audience">circulation</a> and <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2016/06/15/newspapers-fact-sheet/#economics">advertising revenue</a>. So don't blame the interwebs or social media ailments in the news biz.

New medium rarely replace the old. Television didn't kill movies. Despite movies and TV, we still go to live theatre, a two-millennia old media. Think theatre is dead? Try gettting tickets to this weekend's "Hamilton" show.

Legacy media is doing fine: <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/heres-how-americans-spend-their-working-relaxing-and-parenting-time/">quoting FiveThirtyEight</a>, "Americans still spend more time watching TV than all other leisure activities combined". Nielsen Media Research reported</a> <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2016/06/15/audio-fact-sheet/">91% of Americans ages 12 and older had listened to [AM/FM terrestrial radio]"</a> during their week-long survey. 

The <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2016/06/15/newspapers-fact-sheet/#audience">Pew Research Center found</a> more than half the people "who consume a newspaper read it exclusively in print" (just 12 percent are online-only news readers). In a <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/lifestyle/general_lifestyle/april_2012/66_prefer_reading_print_newspaper_to_online_version">Rasmussen Reports survey</a>, "Sixty-six percent (66%) of American Adults say they prefer reading a printed version of the newspaper." And the <a href="http://www.wan-ifra.org/press-releases/2015/06/01/world-press-trends-newspaper-revenues-shift-to-new-sources">World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers calculates</a>, "globally, more than 93 per cent of all newspaper revenues still come from print."

<blockquote>
Results indicated that the (supposedly dying) print product still reaches far more readers than the (supposedly promising) digital product in these newspapers’ home markets, and this holds true across all age groups.

These social-site service on vampiric practices. They suck the content of newspapers and musicians, drool back a little traffic, but feed on all the ad revenue.

Should you'd hire an investigative reporter or a social media strategist? A trick question, because that choice has already been made, over and over, by most newspapers. They haven't add more reporters -- i.e., the source of all their readership. No, they've picked social media as their new focus, in essence, contributing money to their competitors.
