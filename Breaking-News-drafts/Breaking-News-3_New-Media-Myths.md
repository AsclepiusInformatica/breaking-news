<h1>Breaking News 3: New Media Myths</h1>

<em><strong>Breaking News</strong> is about the self-inflicted fractures breaking the news business. Previous posts were on <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-1-how-monetizing-became-malvertising">on malvertising</a> and the <a href=https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-2-when-good-ads-go-bad>ad tech tax</a>.</em>

<h2>Myth: People won't pay for content</h2>

<h2>Myth: The internet is killing newspapers</h2>

Paid circulation has been steadily declining since the 1950s. Newsroom staff cuts started in the late 80s. Both began well before "online news "existed. So accounting for these declines with "online/web/social-media" explanations is, at best, incomplete (esp. since circulation is up since 2009 -- aka, during the social-media age).

The repost of traditional-media's death are greatly exaggerated:
"51% of those who consume a newspaper read it exclusively in print"

"TV accounts for 95 percent of average video consumption"

<h2>Myth: New media makes money</h2>

'Sides Facebook, the sites you list all lose money, many millions annually.

<h2>Myth: We need to disrupt ourselves</h2>

These social-site service on vampiric practices. They suck the content of newspapers and musicians, drool back a little traffic, but feed on all the ad revenue.

Should you'd hire an investigative reporter or a social media strategist? A trick question, because that choice has already been made, over and over, by most newspapers. They haven't add more reporters -- i.e., the source of all their readership. No, they've picked social media as their new focus, in essence, contributing money to their competitors.
