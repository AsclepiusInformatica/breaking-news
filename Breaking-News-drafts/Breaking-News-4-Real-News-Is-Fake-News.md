<h1>Breaking News 4: When real news is fake</h1>

<em><strong>Breaking News</strong> is about the self-inflicted wounds crippling the news business. Previous posts were on <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-1-how-monetizing-became-malvertising">on malvertising</a>, the <a href=https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-2-when-good-ads-go-bad>ad tech tax</a> and <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-3-new-media-myths">new media myths</a>.</em>

Here are in several ways real and fake news are the same. In both:
<ul>
	<li>Most people do not trust the publication.</li>
	<li>No one formally fact-checks the articles.</li>
	<li>The articles often have errors.</li>
	<li>Reported errors rarely get corrected.</li>
	<li>Bogus information surrounds their stories (in comments and chumboxes).</li>
	<li>Publishers profit from criminal ad-tech schemes.</li>
</ul>

The man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them; inasmuch as he who knows nothing is nearer to truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods &amp; errors.

People once believed in the media. In Gallup surveys, "Americans' trust and confidence hit its highest point in 1976, at 72 percent, in the wake of widely lauded examples of investigative journalism regarding Vietnam and the Watergate scandal." But our faith in mainstream media (MSM) "to report the news fully, accurately and fairly" has been plummeting for decades. 

A <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-vanity-fair-poll-modern-workplace/">60 Minutes/Vanity Fair poll</a> asked: "Which industry is the most unethical?" People's "top choice" was Media (37 percent), beating out such paragons of virtue as Big Pharma (30 percent) and bankers (19 percent). Confidence in the media has <a href="https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/survey-research/lose-trust/#chart-1">sunk to near Congressional lows</a>.

Why don't Americans don't trust the media? Maybe because it's not trustworthy.   

<blockquote>
More than 60% of local news and news feature stories in a cross-section of American daily newspapers were found in error by news sources, an inaccuracy rate among the highest reported in nearly seventy years of research, and empirical evidence corroborating the public's impression that mistakes pervade the press. In about every other article, sources identified "hard" objective errors.

</blockquote>

People told the <a href="https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/survey-research/trust-news/">Media Insight Project</a> "accuracy is a critical reason they trust a news source." But <a href="https://www.poynter.org/2012/new-study-shows-how-newspaper-inaccuracies-transcend-journalism-cultures-national-borders/176273/">studies by Scott Maier</a>, of the University of Oregon (Go, Ducks!), show accuracy is not the media's strong suite.
<blockquote>

News errors rarely are corrected. In a study I did of factual errors reported to 10 daily newspapers, I found that nearly all &mdash; 97 percent &mdash; went uncorrected. Nevertheless, survey research indicates the majority of U.S. newspaper editors and reporters believe that a correction "always" follows a detected error. This level of faith is not widely shared by newspaper readers.

This article's prime advice to MSM: To fight fake news, stop being like fake news. Stop looking like it. Stop reading like it. Stop promoting it. Stop funding it.

<h2>Real news funds fake news</h2>
<br />

Fake new is now big business. Its business model depends on the <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-2-when-good-ads-go-bad">fraud-infested ad-tech industry</a>. Ad tech depends on legitimate news sites ignoring <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-1-how-monetizing-became-malvertising">often-illegitimate practices</a>, projected by the <a href="http://www.wfanet.org/pdf/WFA_Compendium_Of_Ad_Fraud_Knowledge.pdf">World Federation of Advertisers</a> (PDF) to become "second only to cocaine and opiate markets as a form of organized crime."

News sites are complicit in creating the most-corrupt, <a href="http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2017/01/display-ads-my-3-worth.html">least-effective advertising</a> in history. Among the numerous online malignancies it has spawned is the thriving fake news business.

<h2>Real news promotes fake news</h2>

<blockquote>
Too often news organizations play a major role in propagating hoaxes, false claims, questionable rumors, and dubious viral content, thereby polluting the digital information stream. Indeed some so-called viral content doesnâ€™t become truly viral until news websites choose to highlight it.
<div><cite>&mdash;Craig Silverman, <a href="http://towcenter.org/research/lies-damn-lies-and-viral-content/">"Lies, Damn Lies, and Viral Content,"</a> Tow Center for Digital Journalism (2015)</cite></div>
</blockquote>

Writing about a fake news story can boost that story's social shares, search engine rank and ad dollars. Linking does the same. (See First Draft News: <a href="https://firstdraftnews.com/debunk-viral-fake-news-story-help-the-hoaxers-stop-it-facebook-megyn-kelly/">"That debunk of a viral fake news story might help the hoaxers: Here's how to stop it."</a>)

Next to most news stories are the sponsored links, those news-like headlines, "recommended" by robots, and <a href="https://theawl.com/a-complete-taxonomy-of-internet-chum-de0b7a070a2d#.2e7umo5mn">known as chumboxes</a>. <a href=" http://changeadvertising.org/the-clickbait-report/">ChangeAdvertising.org</a> estimated "only 46 percent went to what appeared to be legitimate advertisers," while 30 percent linked to clickbait and fake-news sites.

<br />

Below the chumbox sits the steaming pile of partisan bickering labeled Comments. For a dim view of humanity, read the ones under <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2017/01/06/i-hope-ive-made-you-proud-first-lady-michelle-obama-chokes-up-during-speech-to-educators/">this First Lady's speech</a>. 

Why would readers believe a publication prints true, nonpartison stories when false, inflammatory information (in the comments) and links to fraudulent and hyperpartisan sites (in the chumbox) follow each article?

<h2>Real news looks like fake news</h2>

Which of these sites above are real news and which fake? 

Similar design and similar ads make it hard to tell the difference  (<a href="#answers">answers below</a>). There are differences, tho: MSM sites load slower, are less secure and <a href="https://www.mezzobit.com/mainstream-opinionated-news-sites-technology-use/">more invasive of people's privacy</a>.

Fabricated and hyperpartison stories <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/partisan-fb-pages-analysis">propagate faster and farther</a> than real news, making lots of money along the way. Among the beneficiaries are Google and Facebook, who lately proclaim fake news is on their chopping block. But don't be surprised if they end up not killing this cash cow.

MSM must seek salvation elsewhere. A good start would be to make it immediately obvious to readers how real news sites are better, visually and factually.

<h2>Real news reads like fake news</h2>


After <a href="https://www.poynter.org/2012/the-story-of-when-newsweek-ditched-its-fact-checkers-then-made-a-major-error/185899/">major errors surfaced</a> in a Newsweek article, spokesman Andrew Kirk offered this defence: "We, like other news organisations today, rely on our writers to submit factually accurate material." 

So <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/unethical-commentary-newsweek-edition/">Paul Krugman was right</a> when he said, "I guess they donâ€™t do fact-checking." What he neglected to mention was neither does his paper:

<blockquote>
<strong>Fact Checking.</strong> Writers at The Times are their own principal fact checkers and often their only ones.
