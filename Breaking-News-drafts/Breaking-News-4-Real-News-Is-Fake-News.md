<h1>Breaking News 4: Real News is Fake News</h1>

<em><strong>Breaking News</strong> is about the self-inflicted fractures breaking the news business. Previous posts were on <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-1-how-monetizing-became-malvertising">on malvertising</a> and the <a href=https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-2-when-good-ads-go-bad>ad tech tax</a>.</em>

Real news in several ways is often the same as fake news. For both:
<ul>
	<li>No one formally fact-checks the articles.</li>
	<li>The articles are full of errors.</li>
	<li>Reported errors rarely get corrected.</li>
	<li>Most people do not trust the publication.</li>
	<li>Bogus information surrounds their stories (in comments and chumboxes).</li>
	<li>Distracting, annoying ads cover their pages.</li>
	<li>Publishers profit from criminal ad-tech schemes. </li>
</ul>
