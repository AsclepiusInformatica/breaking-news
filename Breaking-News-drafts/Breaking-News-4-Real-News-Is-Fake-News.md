<h1>Breaking News 4: When real news is fake</h1>

<em><strong>Breaking News</strong> is about the self-inflicted wounds crippling the news business. Previous posts were on <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-1-how-monetizing-became-malvertising">on malvertising</a>, the <a href=https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-2-when-good-ads-go-bad>ad tech tax</a> and <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-3-new-media-myths">new media myths</a>.</em>

Here are in several ways real news and fake news are the same. In both:
<ul>
	<li>Most people do not trust the publication.</li>
	<li>No one formally fact-checks the articles.</li>
	<li>The articles often have errors.</li>
	<li>Reported errors rarely get corrected.</li>
	<li>Bogus information surrounds their stories (in comments and chumboxes).</li>
	<li>Publishers profit from criminal ad-tech schemes.</li>
</ul>

<br />

People once believed in the media. In Gallup surveys, "Americans' trust and confidence hit its highest point in 1976, at 72 percent, in the wake of widely lauded examples of investigative journalism regarding Vietnam and the Watergate scandal." But our faith in mainstream media (MSM) "to report the news fully, accurately and fairly" has been plummeting for decades. 

A <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-vanity-fair-poll-modern-workplace/">60 Minutes/Vanity Fair poll</a> asked: "Which industry is the most unethical?" People's "top choice" was Media (37 percent), beating out such paragons of virtue as Big Pharma (30 percent) and bankers (19 percent). Confidence in the media has <a href="https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/survey-research/lose-trust/#chart-1">sunk to near Congressional lows</a>.

Why don't Americans don't trust the media? Maybe because it's not trustworthy.   

<blockquote>
More than 60% of local news and news feature stories in a cross-section of American daily newspapers were found in error by news sources, an inaccuracy rate among the highest reported in nearly seventy years of research, and empirical evidence corroborating the public's impression that mistakes pervade the press. In about every other article, sources identified "hard" objective errors.

</blockquote>

People told the <a href="https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/survey-research/trust-news/">Media Insight Project</a> "accuracy is a critical reason they trust a news source." But <a href="https://www.poynter.org/2012/new-study-shows-how-newspaper-inaccuracies-transcend-journalism-cultures-national-borders/176273/">studies by Scott Maier</a>, of the University of Oregon (Go, Ducks!), show accuracy is not the media's strong suite.
<blockquote>

News errors rarely are corrected. In a study I did of factual errors reported to 10 daily newspapers, I found that nearly all &mdash; 97 percent &mdash; went uncorrected. Nevertheless, survey research indicates the majority of U.S. newspaper editors and reporters believe that a correction "always" follows a detected error. This level of faith is not widely shared by newspaper readers.

This article's prime advice to MSM: To fight fake news, stop being like fake news. Stop looking like it. Stop reading like it. Stop promoting it. Stop funding it.

<h2>Real news funds fake news</h2>
Fake new is now big business. Its business model depends on the <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-2-when-good-ads-go-bad">fraud-infested ad-tech industry</a>. Ad tech depends on legitimate news sites ignoring <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-1-how-monetizing-became-malvertising">often-illegitimate practices</a> &mdash; practices the <a href="http://www.wfanet.org/pdf/WFA_Compendium_Of_Ad_Fraud_Knowledge.pdf">World Federation of Advertisers</a> (PDF) says could become "second only to cocaine and opiate markets as a form of organized crime."

News sites are complicit in creating the most-corrupt, <a href="http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2017/01/display-ads-my-3-worth.html">least-effective advertising</a> in history, spawning numerous online malignancies, including a thriving fake news business.

<h2>Real news promotes fake news</h2>

<blockquote>
Too often news organizations play a major role in propagating hoaxes, false claims, questionable rumors, and dubious viral content, thereby polluting the digital information stream. Indeed some so-called viral content doesn’t become truly viral until news websites choose to highlight it.
<div><cite>&mdash;Craig Silverman, <a href="http://towcenter.org/research/lies-damn-lies-and-viral-content/">"Lies, Damn Lies, and Viral Content,"</a> Tow Center for Digital Journalism (2015)</cite></div>
</blockquote>

Writing about fake news can boost the phony story's social shares, search engine rank and ad dollars. Linking does the same (especially without "nofollow" -- see First Draft News: <a href="https://firstdraftnews.com/debunk-viral-fake-news-story-help-the-hoaxers-stop-it-facebook-megyn-kelly/">"That debunk of a viral fake news story might help the hoaxers: Here's how to stop it."</a>)

Next to most news stories are <a href="https://theawl.com/a-complete-taxonomy-of-internet-chum-de0b7a070a2d#.2e7umo5mn">the chumboxes</a>, those news-like headlines for sponsored links, "recommended" by robots. <a href=" http://changeadvertising.org/the-clickbait-report/">ChangeAdvertising.org</a> estimated "only 46 percent went to what appeared to be legitimate advertisers," while 30 percent linked to clickbait and fake-news sites.

<figcaption><div><em>Source: <a href="http://xkcd.com/1511/">xkcd</a></em></div></figcaption>
</figure>
<br />

Then below all that bait sits the steaming pile of partisan bickering labeled Comments. For a dim view of humanity, read the comments under <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2017/01/06/i-hope-ive-made-you-proud-first-lady-michelle-obama-chokes-up-during-speech-to-educators/">this First Lady's speech</a>. 

Why would readers believe a publication prints true, nonpartison stories when false, inflammatory information follow each article (in the comments) along with links to fake and hyperpartisan sites (in the chumbox)?

<h2>Real news looks like fake news</h2>

<br />

Which of the above are real news and which fake (<a href="#answers">answers below</a>? Similar design and similar ads make it hard to tell the difference.

There are differences, tho: MSM load slower, are less secure and more invasive of people's privacy.

<br />

Fabricated and hyperpartison stories <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/partisan-fb-pages-analysis">propagate faster and farther</a> than real news, making lots of money along the way. Among the beneficiaries are Google and Facebook, who lately proclaim fake news is on their chopping block. But don't be surprised if they end up not killing this cash cow.

MSM must seek salvation elsewhere. And a good start would be to make the differences between real and fake news immediately obvious, visually and factually.

<h2>Real news reads like fake news</h2>


After <a href="https://www.poynter.org/2012/the-story-of-when-newsweek-ditched-its-fact-checkers-then-made-a-major-error/185899/">major errors surfaced</a> in a Newsweek article, spokesman Andrew Kirk offered this defence: "We, like other news organisations today, rely on our writers to submit factually accurate material." 

So <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/unethical-commentary-newsweek-edition/">Paul Krugman was right</a> when he said, "I guess they don’t do fact-checking." What he neglected to mention was neither does his paper:

<blockquote>
<strong>Fact Checking.</strong> Writers at The Times are their own principal fact checkers and often their only ones.

ERIC Schmitt remembers being surprised when, as a member of a Times newsroom committee on reporting practices, he was given information about what bothered readers of The Times most. It wasn’t political bias, or factual errors, or delivery problems. 

“The No. 1 complaint, far and away, was anonymous sources,” Mr. Schmitt, a longtime and well-respected national security reporter in the Washington bureau, told me last week. “It goes to the heart of our credibility.”

### ASNE ###
Teri Hayt, Executive Director American Society of News Editors http://www.asne.org:  
No, ASNE doesn't have any info on who is fact-checking.  I can only surmise that few can do it day-to-day.  I believe that the big investigative pieces are given this treatment but not necessarily the chicken dinner news which is the life-blood of a small organization.

Here are my thoughts on fact-checking in new organizations and maybe this is the avenue you want to explore????: 

As the industry contracted those journalists that worked in the news libraries were laid off, copy desks were been laid off.  Those two groups of journalist - especially at smaller and mid-sized organizations were a wealth of knowledge and reporters would often ask them to double check a fact.  HOW MANY TIMES HAS A COPY DESK EDITOR SAVED A REPORTER FROM A MISTAKE? More times than they care to admit.  This was the value of those two departments.  

The layoffs initially protected "content producers" that is why these groups were the first to feel the pain, they did not actually produce stories, video, graphics, photographs, etc. It became clear to all that laying off these folks, who had extraordinary local knowledge, was going to impact their reporting.  Anecdotaly, errors went up - maybe small ones - the accident was at 200 West Speedway Ave, not East Speedway, or the governor was in office for two terms not three, etc. Again, I am not clear on any actually studies on reporting errors in the age of copy desk free news.

Reporting team leaders are working with their teams to initiate reporting, they edit for clarity and grammar - some can fact check but few can do that  because their teams have grown as more layoffs happen across the news organizations.  I believe that the big investigative pieces do go through a rigorous fact check before publication but not the everyday - chicken dinner news - the reporting on the superintendents or city council meetings, etc. Its that chicken dinner, basic reporting on community news that is so important to readers.

So, I agree with the Slate article. Few are able to fact-check and reporters are responsible for the accuracy of their content.  Reporters have always been responsible but now there is no safety net.

Social Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election (January 2017)
https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/fakenews.pdf
We define “fake news” as news stories that have no factual basis but are presented as facts. By “news stories,” we mean stories that originated in social media or the news media; this excludes false statements originated by political candidates or major political figures. By “presented as facts,” we exclude websites that are well-known to be satire, such as the Onion.

### Backfire ###
When Corrections Fail: The Persistence of Political Misperceptions | SpringerLink  
http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11109-010-9112-2  
An extensive literature addresses citizen ignorance, but very little research focuses on misperceptions. Can these false or unsubstantiated beliefs about politics be corrected? Previous studies have not tested the efficacy of corrections in a realistic format. We conducted four experiments in which subjects read mock news articles that included either a misleading claim from a politician, or a misleading claim and a correction. Results indicate that corrections frequently fail to reduce misperceptions among the targeted ideological group. We also document several instances of a “backfire effect” in which corrections actually increase misperceptions among the group in question.

Fact checking - Wikipedia  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact_checking  
A 2016 study found little evidence for the "backfire effect" (correcting false information may make partisan individuals cling more strongly to their views): "By and large, citizens heed factual information, even when such information challenges their partisan and ideological commitments." 

A study of Trump supporters during the 2016 race similarly found little evidence for the backfire effect: "When respondents read a news article about Mr. Trump’s speech that included F.B.I. statistics indicating that crime had “fallen dramatically and consistently over time,” their misperceptions about crime declined compared with those who saw a version of the article that omitted corrective information (though misperceptions persisted among a sizable minority)."

https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2819073  
Evidence of factual backfire is far more tenuous than prior research suggests. By and large, citizens heed factual information, even when such information challenges their partisan and ideological commitments.
