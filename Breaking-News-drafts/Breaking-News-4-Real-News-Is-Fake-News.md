<h1>Breaking News 4: When real news is fake</h1>

<em><strong>Breaking News</strong> is about the self-inflicted wounds crippling the news business. Previous posts were on <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-1-how-monetizing-became-malvertising">on malvertising</a>, the <a href=https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-2-when-good-ads-go-bad>ad tech tax</a> and <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-3-new-media-myths">new media myths</a>.</em>

Here are in several ways real news and fake news are the same. In both:
<ul>
	<li>Most people do not trust the publication.</li>
	<li>No one formally fact-checks the articles.</li>
	<li>The articles often have errors.</li>
	<li>Reported errors rarely get corrected.</li>
	<li>Bogus information surrounds their stories (in comments and chumboxes).</li>
	<li>Publishers profit from criminal ad-tech schemes.</li>
</ul>

People once believed in the media. In Gallup surveys, "Americans' trust and confidence hit its highest point in 1976, at 72 percent, in the wake of widely lauded examples of investigative journalism regarding Vietnam and the Watergate scandal." But our faith in mainstream media (MSM) "to report the news fully, accurately and fairly" has been plummeting for decades. 

A <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-vanity-fair-poll-modern-workplace/">60 Minutes/Vanity Fair poll</a> asked: "Which industry is the most unethical?" People's "top choice" was Media (37 percent), beating out such paragons of virtue as Big Pharma (30 percent) and bankers (19 percent). Confidence in the media has <a href="https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/survey-research/lose-trust/#chart-1">sunk to near Congressional lows</a>.

Why don't Americans don't trust the media? Maybe because it's not trustworthy.   

<blockquote>
More than 60% of local news and news feature stories in a cross-section of American daily newspapers were found in error by news sources, an inaccuracy rate among the highest reported in nearly seventy years of research, and empirical evidence corroborating the public's impression that mistakes pervade the press. In about every other article, sources identified "hard" objective errors.

</blockquote>

People told the <a href="https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/survey-research/trust-news/">Media Insight Project</a> "accuracy is a critical reason they trust a news source." But <a href="https://www.poynter.org/2012/new-study-shows-how-newspaper-inaccuracies-transcend-journalism-cultures-national-borders/176273/">studies by Scott Maier</a>, of the University of Oregon (Go, Ducks!), show accuracy is not the media's strong suite.
<blockquote>

News errors rarely are corrected. In a study I did of factual errors reported to 10 daily newspapers, I found that nearly all &mdash; 97 percent &mdash; went uncorrected. Nevertheless, survey research indicates the majority of U.S. newspaper editors and reporters believe that a correction "always" follows a detected error. This level of faith is not widely shared by newspaper readers.

This article's prime advice to MSM: To fight fake news, stop being like fake news. Stop looking like it. Stop reading like it. Stop promoting it. Stop funding it.

<h2>Real news funds fake news</h2>
Fake new is now big business. Its business model depends on the <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-2-when-good-ads-go-bad">fraud-infested ad-tech industry</a>. Ad tech depends on legitimate news sites ignoring <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-1-how-monetizing-became-malvertising">often-illegitimate practices</a> &mdash; practices the <a href="http://www.wfanet.org/pdf/WFA_Compendium_Of_Ad_Fraud_Knowledge.pdf">World Federation of Advertisers</a> (PDF) says could become "second only to cocaine and opiate markets as a form of organized crime."

News sites are complicit in creating the most-corrupt, <a href="http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2017/01/display-ads-my-3-worth.html">least-effective advertising</a> in history, spawning numerous online malignancies, including a thriving fake news business.

<h2>Real news promotes fake news</h2>

Next to most news stories are <a href="https://theawl.com/a-complete-taxonomy-of-internet-chum-de0b7a070a2d#.2e7umo5mn">the chumboxes</a>, those news-like headlines for sponsored links, "recommended" by robots. <a href=" http://changeadvertising.org/the-clickbait-report/">ChangeAdvertising.org</a> estimated "only 46 percent went to what appeared to be legitimate advertisers," while 30 percent linked to clickbait and fake-news sites.

<br />

</figure>
<br />

Then below all that bait sits the steaming pile of partisan bickering labeled Comments. For a dim view of humanity, read the comments under <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2017/01/06/i-hope-ive-made-you-proud-first-lady-michelle-obama-chokes-up-during-speech-to-educators/">this First Lady's speech</a>. 

Why would readers believe a publication prints true, nonpartison stories when false, inflammatory information follow each article (in the comments) along with links to fake and hyperpartisan sites (in the chumbox)?

<h2>Real news looks like fake news</h2>

<br />

<br />

Which of the above are real news and which fake (<a href="#answers">answers below</a>? Similar design and similar ads make it hard to tell the difference.

There are differences, tho: MSM load slower, are less secure and more invasive of people's privacy.

<br />

Fabricated and hyperpartison stories <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/partisan-fb-pages-analysis">propagate faster and farther</a> than real news, making lots of money along the way. Among the beneficiaries are Google and Facebook, who lately proclaim fake news is on their chopping block. But don't be surprised if they end up not killing this cash cow.

MSM must seek salvation elsewhere. And a good start would be to make the differences between real and fake news immediately obvious, visually and factually.

<h2>Real news reads like fake news</h2>

<blockquote>
After publishing an article with <a href="https://www.poynter.org/2012/the-story-of-when-newsweek-ditched-its-fact-checkers-then-made-a-major-error/185899/">major errors</a>, Newsweek spokesman Andrew Kirk offered this defence: "We, like other news organisations today, rely on our writers to submit factually accurate material." 

So <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/unethical-commentary-newsweek-edition/">Paul krugman was right when he said</a>, "I guess they donâ€™t do fact-checking." What he neglected to mention was neither does his paper:

<blockquote>
<strong>Fact Checking.</strong> Writers at The Times are their own principal fact checkers and often their only ones.

Readers can't be expected to whether or not a site is legit when real news looks like, reads like, and recommends links to fake and hyper-partisan sites. Publishers, heal thyself.
