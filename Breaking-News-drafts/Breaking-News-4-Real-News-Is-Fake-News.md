<h1>Breaking News 4: When Real News is Fake</h1>

<em><strong>Breaking News</strong> is about the self-inflicted wounds crippling the news business. Previous posts were on <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-1-how-monetizing-became-malvertising">on malvertising</a>, the <a href=https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-2-when-good-ads-go-bad>ad tech tax</a> and <a href=" https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-3-new-media-myths">new media myths</a>.</em>

Here are in several ways real news and fake news are the same. In both:
<ul>
	<li>Most people do not trust the publication.</li>
	<li>No one formally fact-checks the articles.</li>
	<li>The articles are full of errors.</li>
	<li>Reported errors rarely get corrected.</li>
	<li>Distracting, annoying ads cover their pages.</li>
	<li>Bogus information surrounds their stories (in comments and chumboxes).</li>
	<li>Publishers profit from criminal ad-tech schemes.</li>
</ul>

The man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them; inasmuch as he who knows nothing is nearer to truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods &amp; errors.

People once trusted the media. In Gallup surveys, "Americans' trust and confidence hit its highest point in 1976, at 72 percent, in the wake of widely lauded examples of investigative journalism regarding Vietnam and the Watergate scandal." But our faith in the media "to report the news fully, accurately and fairly" has been plummeting for decades. 

A <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-vanity-fair-poll-modern-workplace/">60 Minutes/Vanity Fair poll</a> asked: "Which industry is the most unethical?" People's "top choice" was Media (37 percent), beating out such paragons of virtue as Big Pharma (30 percent) and bankers (19 percent).

Maybe Americans don't trust mainstream media because it's not trustworthy.   

<blockquote>
More than 60% of local news and news feature stories in a cross-section of American daily newspapers were found in error by news sources, an inaccuracy rate among the highest reported in nearly seventy years of research, and empirical evidence corroborating the public's impression that mistakes pervade the press. In about every other article, sources identified "hard" objective errors.

People told the <a href="https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/survey-research/trust-news/">Media Insight Project</a> "accuracy is a critical reason they trust a news source." But <a href="https://www.poynter.org/2012/new-study-shows-how-newspaper-inaccuracies-transcend-journalism-cultures-national-borders/176273/">studies by Scott Maier</a>, of the University of Oregon (Go, Ducks!), show accuracy is not the media's strong suite. And when readers report these errors, editors stuck to their inaccurate stories.

<blockquote>
News errors rarely are corrected. In a study I did of factual errors reported to 10 daily newspapers, I found that nearly all -- 97 percent -- went uncorrected. Nevertheless, survey research indicates the majority of U.S. newspaper editors and reporters believe that a correction "always" follows a detected error. This level of faith is not widely shared by newspaper readers.

Her's the main piece of advice this artcile has to offer mainstream media: To fight fake news, stop being like fake news. Stop funding and promoting it. Stop looking like it and stop reading like it.

<h2>Real news funds fake news</h2>
Fake new is now big business. Its business model depends on the <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-2-when-good-ads-go-bad">fraud-infested ad-tech industry</a>, which depends on legitimate news sites being revenue-desparate enough to ignore <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/stories/breaking-news-1-how-monetizing-became-malvertising">ad-tech's often-illegitimate practices</a> -- practices on track to become <a href="http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2016/12/huge-video-ad-fraud-uncovered.html">the second most-profitable criminal enterprise</a>.
