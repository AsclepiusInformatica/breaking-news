* The headline uses ALL CAPS
* The headline makes a claim or statement that is not backed up by any of the info the story itself.
* The author is not listed, or they use a pseudonym.
* The site does not have an About page, or the page doesn’t clearly say who is behind it.

* The story doesn’t have any links.
* The story has links, but they don’t go to credible sources you’re familiar with, or they take you to homepages rather than specific articles.
* There are no other stories about this same story/claim in Google News.
* The URL pretends to be a real news site, like ABCNews.com.co.
* You Google the URL and get a result from Snopes.com that was false.

https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/detect-fake-news-like-a-pro-1  
https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/detect-fake-news-like-a-pro-2
* 1. Check the URL. Where is this story from?
* 2. Read the About page. Are they clear about who is running the site, and do they say anything about it being satirical or full of fake news?
* 3. If the story has a quote from someone prominent, or from an official such as a police officer, copy and paste it into a search engine.
* 4. Click on links in the story, and beware of a lack of links or recognizable sources.
* 5. Do a reverse image search on photos or other art in the story.
* 6. If the story seems too perfect, too good to be true, or gives you a strong emotional reaction, slow down for a moment.

* CONSIDER THE SOURCE  
Click away from the story to investigate the site, its mission and its contact info.
* READ BEYOND  
Headlines can be outrageous in an effort to get clicks. What’s the whole story?
* CHECK THE AUTHOR  
Do a quick search on the author. Are they credible? Are they real?
* SUPPORTING SOURCES?  
Click on those links. Determine if the info given actually supports the story.
CHECK THE DATE  
Reposting old news stories doesn’t mean they’re relevant to current events.
* IS IT A JOKE?  
If it is too outlandish, it might be satire. Research the site and author to be sure.
* CHECK YOUR BIASES   
Consider if your own beliefs could affect your judgement.
* ASK THE EXPERTS  
Ask a librarian, or consult a fact-checking site.

### On the Media ###

BREAKING NEWS CONSUMER'S HANDBOOK  
FAKE NEWS EDITION 
* 1. Big red flags for fake news: ALL CAPS, or obviously photoshopped pics.
* 2. A glut of pop·ups and banner ads? Good sign the story is pure clickbait.
* 3. Check the domain! Fake sites often add ".co" to trusted brands to steal their luster. (Think: "abcnews.com.co")
* 4. If you land on an unknown site, check its "About" page. Then, Google it with the word "fake" and see what comes up.
* 5. If a story offers links, follow them. (Garbage leads to worse garbage.) No links, quotes, or references? Another telltale sign.
* 6. Verify an unlikely story by finding a reputable outlet reporting the same thing.
* 7. Check the date. Social media often resurrects outdated stories.
* 8. Read past headlines. Often they bear no resemblance to what lies beneath.
* 9. Photos may be misidentified and dated. Use a reverse image search engine like TinEye to see where an image really comes from.
* 10. Gut check. If a story makes you angry, it's probably designed that way.
* 11. Finally, if you're not sure it's true, don't share it! *Don't. Share. It.*

### OpenSources ###
http://www.opensources.co/  
https://github.com/BigMcLargeHuge/opensources  
OpenSources is a curated resource for assessing online information sources… a continuously updated database of information sources.  
Our Methods:
* Step 1: Title/Domain Analysis. If “.wordpress” “.com.co” appear in the title -- or any slight variation on a well known website-- this is usually a sign there is a problem.
* Step 2: About Us Analysis. Google every title/domain name/anyone listed in the “About Us” section to see if anyone has previously reported on the website (snopes, hoax-slayer, factcheck.org, etc.) or whether it has a Wikipedia page with citations or something similar detailing its background. This is useful for identifying and correctly categorizing lesser known and/or new websites that may be on the up-and-up, such as satirical sources or websites that are explicit about their political orientation.
* Step 3: Source Analysis. Does the website mention/link to a study or source? Look up the source/study. Is it being accurately reflected and reported? Are officials being cited? Can a primary source be located for its quotations? Some media literacy and critical scholars call this triangulation: Verify details, facts, quotes, etc. with multiple sources.
* Step 4: Writing Style Analysis. Does the website follow AP Style Guide? Typically, lack of style guide use signifies questionable, more opinion-oriented practices, and may indicate an overall lack of editing or fact-checking process. Does it frequently use ALL CAPS in headlines and/or body text? Does the headline or body of the text use phrases like "WOW!!!!"? This stylistic practice and these types of hyperbolic word choices are often used to create emotional responses with readers that is avoided in more traditional journalism and isn’t something that would be permitted or encouraged by the AP Style Guide
* Step 5: Aesthetic Analysis. Like the style-guide, many fake and questionable news sites utilize very bad design. Are screens are cluttered and they use heavy-handed photo-shopping or born digital images?
* Step 6: Social Media Analysis. Look up the website on Facebook. Do the headlines and posts rely on sensational or provocative language (aka click-bait) in order to attract attention and encourage likes, click-throughs, and shares? Do the headlines and social media descriptions match or accurately reflect the content of the linked article? (this step isn’t particularly good at helping us find fake news, but it can help us identify other misleading news sources)

http://ufsocial.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SourceCredibility.zip  
Story Credibility Assignment   
* Source: where does the story come from? Does the site have an ABOUT page? Does the ABOUT page say what the site’s mission is? Can you find the site’s staff members? Does the site have a physical location and offices where their reporters work? 
* The Headline: headlines are made to be sensational even at legitimate news organizations. Does the body of the story support the headline? Is the headline intended to lead the audience to click on a story but then doesn’t match the headline in tone or content? 
* Author: look at the byline. Who wrote the story? Are they a real person? Does the author have a photograph included? Is the photograph of a real person?  Does the author have an ABOUT page on the site or a biography at the bottom of the story?  
* Supporting Material: even fake news will cite legitimate sources. Does the story link to source material? Does the source support the point made in the story? Often the links go to an official source, but the source material does not support the points made and instead creates the appearance of legitimacy.   
* Check the date: some stories are not fake. Some stories are just old. But these old stories have been repackaged to relate to a current event or are being shared years after the event occurred. 
* Joke: some sites are clearly hoax sites like. Is this a hoax site?
* Are you biased: remember confirmation bias can lead us to believe stories that we want to believe are true. Objective reporting should provide all valid sides to a story. Does the story present just the side you agree with or only presents arguments where you disagree? 
* Check the experts: Factcheck.org, PolitiFact.com, and Snopes.com have already debunked a lot of fake news. So check with them.
