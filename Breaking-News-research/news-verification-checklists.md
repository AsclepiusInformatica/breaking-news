BREAKING NEWS CONSUMER'S HANDBOOK: FAKE NEWS EDITION 
1. Big red flags for fake news: ALL CAPS, or obviously photoshopped pics.
1. A glut of pop·ups and banner ads? Good sign the story is pure clickbait.
1. Check the domain! Fake sites often add ".co" to trusted brands to steal their luster. (Think: "abcnews.com.co")
1. If you land on an unknown site, check its "About" page. Then, Google it with the word "fake" and see what comes up.
1. If a story offers links, follow them. (Garbage leads to worse garbage.) No links, quotes, or references? Another telltale sign.
1. Verify an unlikely story by finding a reputable outlet reporting the same thing.
1. Check the date. Social media often resurrects outdated stories.
1. Read past headlines. Often they bear no resemblance to what lies beneath.
1. Photos may be misidentified and dated. Use a reverse image search engine like TinEye to see where an image really comes from.
1. Gut check. If a story makes you angry, it's probably designed that way.
1. Finally, if you're not sure it's true, don't share it! *Don't. Share. It.*

* CONSIDER THE SOURCE  
Click away from the story to investigate the site, its mission and its contact info.
* READ BEYOND  
Headlines can be outrageous in an effort to get clicks. What’s the whole story?
* CHECK THE AUTHOR  
Do a quick search on the author. Are they credible? Are they real?
* SUPPORTING SOURCES?  
Click on those links. Determine if the info given actually supports the story.
CHECK THE DATE  
Reposting old news stories doesn’t mean they’re relevant to current events.
* IS IT A JOKE?  
If it is too outlandish, it might be satire. Research the site and author to be sure.
* CHECK YOUR BIASES   
Consider if your own beliefs could affect your judgement.
* ASK THE EXPERTS  
Ask a librarian, or consult a fact-checking site.

Tips to Spot False News (2017)
https://www.facebook.com/help/188118808357379  
1. Be skeptical of headlines. False news stories often have catchy headlines in all caps with exclamation points. If shocking claims in the headline sound unbelievable, they probably are.
1. Look closely at the URL. A phony or look-alike URL may be a warning sign of false news. Many false news sites mimic authentic news sources by making small changes to the URL. You can go to the site to compare the URL to established sources.
1. Investigate the source. Ensure that the story is written by a source that you trust with a reputation for accuracy. If the story comes from an unfamiliar organization, check their "About" section to learn more.
1. Watch for unusual formatting. Many false news sites have misspellings or awkward layouts. Read carefully if you see these signs.
1. Consider the photos. False news stories often contain manipulated images or videos. Sometimes the photo may be authentic, but taken out of context. You can search for the photo or image to verify where it came from.
1. Inspect the dates. False news stories may contain timelines that make no sense, or event dates that have been altered.
1. Check the evidence. Check the author's sources to confirm that they are accurate. Lack of evidence or reliance on unnamed experts may indicate a false news story.
1. Look at other reports. If no other news source is reporting the same story, it may indicate that the story is false. If the story is reported by multiple sources you trust, it's more likely to be true.
1. Is the story a joke? Sometimes false news stories can be hard to distinguish from humor or satire. Check whether the source is known for parody, and whether the story's details and tone suggest it may be just for fun.
1. Some stories are intentionally false. Think critically about the stories you read, and only share news that you know to be credible.

https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/detect-fake-news-like-a-pro-2
1. Check the URL. Where is this story from?
1. Read the About page. Are they clear about who is running the site, and do they say anything about it being satirical or full of fake news?
1. If the story has a quote from someone prominent, or from an official such as a police officer, copy and paste it into a search engine.
1. Click on links in the story, and beware of a lack of links or recognizable sources.
1. Do a reverse image search on photos or other art in the story.
1. If the story seems too perfect, too good to be true, or gives you a strong emotional reaction, slow down for a moment.

### OpenSources ###
http://www.opensources.co/  
https://github.com/BigMcLargeHuge/opensources  
OpenSources is a curated resource for assessing online information sources… a continuously updated database of information sources.  
Our Methods:
* Step 1: Title/Domain Analysis. If “.wordpress” “.com.co” appear in the title -- or any slight variation on a well known website-- this is usually a sign there is a problem.
* Step 2: About Us Analysis. Google every title/domain name/anyone listed in the “About Us” section to see if anyone has previously reported on the website (snopes, hoax-slayer, factcheck.org, etc.) or whether it has a Wikipedia page with citations or something similar detailing its background. This is useful for identifying and correctly categorizing lesser known and/or new websites that may be on the up-and-up, such as satirical sources or websites that are explicit about their political orientation.
* Step 3: Source Analysis. Does the website mention/link to a study or source? Look up the source/study. Is it being accurately reflected and reported? Are officials being cited? Can a primary source be located for its quotations? Some media literacy and critical scholars call this triangulation: Verify details, facts, quotes, etc. with multiple sources.
* Step 4: Writing Style Analysis. Does the website follow AP Style Guide? Typically, lack of style guide use signifies questionable, more opinion-oriented practices, and may indicate an overall lack of editing or fact-checking process. Does it frequently use ALL CAPS in headlines and/or body text? Does the headline or body of the text use phrases like "WOW!!!!"? This stylistic practice and these types of hyperbolic word choices are often used to create emotional responses with readers that is avoided in more traditional journalism and isn’t something that would be permitted or encouraged by the AP Style Guide
* Step 5: Aesthetic Analysis. Like the style-guide, many fake and questionable news sites utilize very bad design. Are screens are cluttered and they use heavy-handed photo-shopping or born digital images?
* Step 6: Social Media Analysis. Look up the website on Facebook. Do the headlines and posts rely on sensational or provocative language (aka click-bait) in order to attract attention and encourage likes, click-throughs, and shares? Do the headlines and social media descriptions match or accurately reflect the content of the linked article? (this step isn’t particularly good at helping us find fake news, but it can help us identify other misleading news sources)

http://ufsocial.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SourceCredibility.zip  
Story Credibility Assignment   
* Source: where does the story come from? Does the site have an ABOUT page? Does the ABOUT page say what the site’s mission is? Can you find the site’s staff members? Does the site have a physical location and offices where their reporters work? 
* The Headline: headlines are made to be sensational even at legitimate news organizations. Does the body of the story support the headline? Is the headline intended to lead the audience to click on a story but then doesn’t match the headline in tone or content? 
* Author: look at the byline. Who wrote the story? Are they a real person? Does the author have a photograph included? Is the photograph of a real person?  Does the author have an ABOUT page on the site or a biography at the bottom of the story?  
* Supporting Material: even fake news will cite legitimate sources. Does the story link to source material? Does the source support the point made in the story? Often the links go to an official source, but the source material does not support the points made and instead creates the appearance of legitimacy.   
* Check the date: some stories are not fake. Some stories are just old. But these old stories have been repackaged to relate to a current event or are being shared years after the event occurred. 
* Joke: some sites are clearly hoax sites like. Is this a hoax site?
* Are you biased: remember confirmation bias can lead us to believe stories that we want to believe are true. Objective reporting should provide all valid sides to a story. Does the story present just the side you agree with or only presents arguments where you disagree? 
* Check the experts: Factcheck.org, PolitiFact.com, and Snopes.com have already debunked a lot of fake news. So check with them.

1. Gauge your emotional reaction: Is it strong? Are you angry? Are you intensely hoping that the information turns out to be true? False?
1. Reflect on how you encountered this. Was it promoted on a website? Did it show up in a social media feed? Was it sent to you by someone you know?
1. Consider the headline or main message:
    * a. Does it use excessive punctuation(!!) or ALL CAPS for emphasis?
    * b. Does it make a claim about containing a secret or telling you something that “the media” doesn’t want you to know?
    * c. Don’t stop at the headline! Keep exploring.
1. Is this information designed for easy sharing, like a meme?
1. Consider the source of the information:
    * a. Is it a well-known source?
    * b. Is there a byline (an author’s name) attached to this piece?
    * c. Go to the website’s “About” section: Does the site describe itself as a “fantasy news” or “satirical news” site?
    * d. Does the person or organization that produced the information have any editorial standards?
    * e. Does the “contact us” section include an email address that matches the domain (not a Gmail or Yahoo email address)?
    * f. Does a quick search for the name of the website raise any suspicions?
1. Does the example you’re evaluating have a current date on it?
1. Does the example cite a variety of sources, including official and expert sources? Does the information this example provides appear in reports from (other) news outlets?
1. Does the example hyperlink to other quality sources? In other words, they haven’t been altered or taken from another context?
1. Can you confirm, using a reverse image search, that any images in your example are authentic (in other words, sources that haven’t been altered or taken from another context)?
1. If you searched for this example on a fact-checking site such as Snopes.com, FactCheck.org or PolitiFact.com, is there a fact-check that labels it as less than true?

<h3 id="watergate">All the President's Men</h3>
All the President's Men, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward (1974)

<blockquote>Gradually, an unwritten rule was evolving: unless two sources confirmed a charge involving activity likely to be considered criminal, the specific allegation was not used in the paper.<br> 
(pg 79)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I don't care if it's a word, a phrase, a sentence, a paragraph, a whole story or an entire series of stories," he said. "When in doubt, leave it out."  
—Howard Simons, Managing Editor, Washington Post<br>
(pg 114)</blockquote>

<blockquote>The rule was: Lay it out piece by piece, white what you know is solid; the big picture can wait.<br>  
(pg 129)</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Nixon White House worried him. "They are all underhanded and unknowable," he had said numerous times. He also distrusted the press. "I don't like newspapers," he had said flatly. He detested inexactitude and shallowness.  
—Deep Throat<br>
(pg 131)</blockquote>


Afterword, Marking the fortieth anniversary of Watergate
<blockquote><strong>The war on the news media</strong>

In response to suspected leaks to the press about Vietnam, Kissinger had ordered FBI wiretaps in 1969 on the telephones of 17 journalists and White House aides, without court approval. Many news stories based on the purported leaks questioned progress in the American war effort, further fueling the antiwar movement. In a tape from the Oval Office on Feb. 22, 1971, Nixon said, “In the short run, it would be so much easier, wouldn’t it, to run this war in a dictatorial way, kill all the reporters and carry on the war.”

“The press is your enemy,” Nixon explained five days later in a meeting with Adm. Thomas H. Moorer, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, according to another tape. “Enemies. Understand that? . . . Now, never act that way . . . give them a drink, you know, treat them nice, you just love it, you’re trying to be helpful. But don’t help the bastards. Ever. Because they’re trying to stick the knife right in our groin.”<br>
(pg 340)</blockquote>  
"Woodward and Bernstein: 40 years after Watergate, Nixon was far worse than we thought"

<h3>Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72</h3>  
<blockquote>Objective Journalism is a hard thing to come by these days. We all yearn for it, but who can point the way? The only man who comes to mind, right offhand, is my good friend and colleague on the Sports Desk, Raoul Duke. Most journalists only <em>talk</em> about objectivity, but Dr. Duke grabs it straight by the fucking throat. You will be hard-pressed to find any argument, among professionals, on the question of Dr. Duke's Objectivity.
 
As for mine ... well, my doctor says it swole up and busted about :en years ago. The only thing I ever saw that came dose to Objective Journalism was a closed-circuit TV setup that watched shoplifters in the General Store at Woody Creek, Colorado. I always admired that machine, but I noticed that nobody paid much attention to it until one of those known, heavy, out-front shoplifters came into the place ... but when that happened, everybody got so excited that the thief had to do something quick, like buy a green popsicle or a can of Coors and get out -the place immediately. 

So much for Objective Journalism. Don't bother to look for it here —
not under any byline of mine; or anyone else I can think of. With the possible exception of things like box scores, race results, and stock mar­tabulations, there is no such thing as Objective Journalism. The phrase itself is a pompous contradiction in terms.<br> 
(pg 33)</blockquote> 

<blockquote>We were halfway down the ramp to the parking lot before I understood what had happened. "That gin-soaked little Nazi from the <em>Gazette</em> got pissed off when you didn't doff your hat for the national anthem," Burgin explained. "He kept bitching about you to the guy in charge of :he press box, then he got that asshole who works for him all cranked up and they started talking about having you arrested." 

"Jesus creeping shit," I muttered. "Now I know why I got out of sportswriting. Christ, I had no idea what was happening. You should have warned me." 

"I was afraid you'd run amok," he said. "We'd have been in bad trouble. All those guys from things like the <em>Norfolk Ledger</em> and the <em>Army-Navy Times</em>. They would have stomped us like rats in a closet." 

I couldn't understand it. "Hell, I'd have taken the goddamn hat off, if thought it was causing trouble. I barely even <em>remember</em> the national anthem. Usually, I don't even stand up." 

"I didn't think you were going to," he said. "I didn't want to say anything, but I knew we were doomed." 

"But I did stand," I said. "I figured, hell, I'm Dave's guest — why not stand and make it easy for him? But I never even thought about my god­damn hat." 

Actually, I was happy to get out of that place. The Redskins were losing, which pleased me, and we were thrown out just in time to get back to Burgin's house for the 49er game on TY. If they won this one, they would go against the Redskins next Sunday in the playoffs — and by the end of the third quarter I had worked myself into a genuine hate frenzy; I was howling like a butcher when the 49ers pulled it out in the final moments with a series of desperate maneuvers, and the moment the gun sounded I was on the phone to TWA, securing a seat on the Christmas Nite Special to San Francisco. It was extremely important, I felt, to go out there and do everything possible to make sure the Redskins got the mortal piss beaten out of them.<br>

<blockquote>After two or three weeks of this madness, you begin to feel As One with the man who said, "No news is good news." In twenty-eight papers, only the rarest kind of luck will turn up more than two or three articles of any interest ... but even then the interest items are usually buried deep around paragraph 16 on the jump (or "Cont. on... ") page... 

The <em>Post</em> will have a story about Muskie making a speech in Iowa. The <em>Star</em> will say the same thing, and the <em>Journal</em> will say nothing at all. But the <em>Times</em> might have enough room on the jump page to include a line or so that says something like: "When he finished his speech, Muskie burst into tears and seized his campaign manager by the side of the neck. They grappled briefly, but the struggle was kicked apart by an oriental woman who seemed to be in control."

Now that's good journalism. Totally objective; very active and straight to the point. But we need to know more. <em>Who</em> was that woman? <em>Why</em> did they fight? <strong>Where</strong> was Muskie taken? <em>What</em> was he saying when the microphone broke?<br>

<blockquote>"Just a bunch of pansies from CBS and the New York Times, hanging around the bar," he said. "I took a few bites out of that crowd and they faded fast — just ran off like curs. But what the shit can you expect from people like that? Just a bunch of lowlife ass-kissers who get paid for hanging around with politicians."<br>

<blockquote>Yes .... The Zoo Plane: I'm not sure who named it chat, but the name derived from the nature of the behavior of the people on it ... It was very much like a human zoo, and I recall particularly that last flight from Long Beach to Sioux Falls ... I remembe1 Tim Crouse's description of how the older and straighter press people muse have felt when they saw five or six freaks reeling around in the cockpit on takeoff and landing, passing joints around. As Tim said, you can imagine how these guys felt. They had heard all these terrible things, they'd read stories about how people in dark corners gathered to pass drugs around, and they always thought that it happened in urine-soaked doorways around Times Square. But all of a sudden here we were covering a presidential campaign and there were joints being passed up and down the aisle: weird people in the cockpit ... drug addicts ... lunatics ... crowding into the cockpit just to get high and wired on the lights. The cockpit had millions of lights all around it ... green lights ... red lights ... all kinds of blinking things — a wonderful place to be. That surge of power in a jet ... you don't gee any real sense of it back in the passenger seats, but the feeling ... up in front is like riding God's own motorcycle.<br>

<blockquote>American traditions and the American ethic require us to be truthful, but the most important reason is that truth is the best propaganda and lies are the worst. To be persuasive we must be believable; to be believable we must be credible; to be credible we must be truthful. It is as simple as that.<br>

<blockquote>Fred Thompson, who before he was a senator and an actor on “Law & Order” was the lead counsel to the Republicans on the Senate committee investigating Watergate, is still gleeful as he recalls the damning testimony of John Dean, the White House counsel who described the president’s role in the cover-up. “You can’t have anything worse happen to you than your own lawyer turning against you,” Mr. Thompson says with a deep chuckle.<blockquote>

<blockquote>Ben Stein, who is glimpsed as a young man in the footage of doleful White House staffers listening to Nixon’s farewell speech in the East Room (“My mother was a saint,” etc.), reflects on it once more: “It’s really sad. I don’t think any president has been more persecuted than Nixon. I think he was a saint.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1:23:20) One thing about Watergate: It was gonna change the culture of Washington. It did no such thing. You know this kind of thing is going to happen again. And it's going to happen in a much, much bigger scale.
