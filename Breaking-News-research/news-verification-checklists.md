Tips to Spot False News (2017)
https://www.facebook.com/help/188118808357379  
1. Be skeptical of headlines. False news stories often have catchy headlines in all caps with exclamation points. If shocking claims in the headline sound unbelievable, they probably are.
1. Look closely at the URL. A phony or look-alike URL may be a warning sign of false news. Many false news sites mimic authentic news sources by making small changes to the URL. You can go to the site to compare the URL to established sources.
1. Investigate the source. Ensure that the story is written by a source that you trust with a reputation for accuracy. If the story comes from an unfamiliar organization, check their "About" section to learn more.
1. Watch for unusual formatting. Many false news sites have misspellings or awkward layouts. Read carefully if you see these signs.
1. Consider the photos. False news stories often contain manipulated images or videos. Sometimes the photo may be authentic, but taken out of context. You can search for the photo or image to verify where it came from.
1. Inspect the dates. False news stories may contain timelines that make no sense, or event dates that have been altered.
1. Check the evidence. Check the author's sources to confirm that they are accurate. Lack of evidence or reliance on unnamed experts may indicate a false news story.
1. Look at other reports. If no other news source is reporting the same story, it may indicate that the story is false. If the story is reported by multiple sources you trust, it's more likely to be true.
1. Is the story a joke? Sometimes false news stories can be hard to distinguish from humor or satire. Check whether the source is known for parody, and whether the story's details and tone suggest it may be just for fun.
1. Some stories are intentionally false. Think critically about the stories you read, and only share news that you know to be credible.

* The author is not listed, or they use a pseudonym.
* The site does not have an About page, or the page doesn’t clearly say who is behind it.

https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/detect-fake-news-like-a-pro-2
* 1. Check the URL. Where is this story from?
* 2. Read the About page. Are they clear about who is running the site, and do they say anything about it being satirical or full of fake news?
* 3. If the story has a quote from someone prominent, or from an official such as a police officer, copy and paste it into a search engine.
* 4. Click on links in the story, and beware of a lack of links or recognizable sources.
* 5. Do a reverse image search on photos or other art in the story.
* 6. If the story seems too perfect, too good to be true, or gives you a strong emotional reaction, slow down for a moment.

* CONSIDER THE SOURCE  
Click away from the story to investigate the site, its mission and its contact info.
* READ BEYOND  
Headlines can be outrageous in an effort to get clicks. What’s the whole story?
* CHECK THE AUTHOR  
Do a quick search on the author. Are they credible? Are they real?
* SUPPORTING SOURCES?  
Click on those links. Determine if the info given actually supports the story.
CHECK THE DATE  
Reposting old news stories doesn’t mean they’re relevant to current events.
* IS IT A JOKE?  
If it is too outlandish, it might be satire. Research the site and author to be sure.
* CHECK YOUR BIASES   
Consider if your own beliefs could affect your judgement.
* ASK THE EXPERTS  
Ask a librarian, or consult a fact-checking site.

BREAKING NEWS CONSUMER'S HANDBOOK  
FAKE NEWS EDITION 
* 1. Big red flags for fake news: ALL CAPS, or obviously photoshopped pics.
* 2. A glut of pop·ups and banner ads? Good sign the story is pure clickbait.
* 3. Check the domain! Fake sites often add ".co" to trusted brands to steal their luster. (Think: "abcnews.com.co")
* 4. If you land on an unknown site, check its "About" page. Then, Google it with the word "fake" and see what comes up.
* 5. If a story offers links, follow them. (Garbage leads to worse garbage.) No links, quotes, or references? Another telltale sign.
* 6. Verify an unlikely story by finding a reputable outlet reporting the same thing.
* 7. Check the date. Social media often resurrects outdated stories.
* 8. Read past headlines. Often they bear no resemblance to what lies beneath.
* 9. Photos may be misidentified and dated. Use a reverse image search engine like TinEye to see where an image really comes from.
* 10. Gut check. If a story makes you angry, it's probably designed that way.
* 11. Finally, if you're not sure it's true, don't share it! *Don't. Share. It.*

### OpenSources ###
http://www.opensources.co/  
https://github.com/BigMcLargeHuge/opensources  
OpenSources is a curated resource for assessing online information sources… a continuously updated database of information sources.  
Our Methods:
* Step 1: Title/Domain Analysis. If “.wordpress” “.com.co” appear in the title -- or any slight variation on a well known website-- this is usually a sign there is a problem.
* Step 2: About Us Analysis. Google every title/domain name/anyone listed in the “About Us” section to see if anyone has previously reported on the website (snopes, hoax-slayer, factcheck.org, etc.) or whether it has a Wikipedia page with citations or something similar detailing its background. This is useful for identifying and correctly categorizing lesser known and/or new websites that may be on the up-and-up, such as satirical sources or websites that are explicit about their political orientation.
* Step 3: Source Analysis. Does the website mention/link to a study or source? Look up the source/study. Is it being accurately reflected and reported? Are officials being cited? Can a primary source be located for its quotations? Some media literacy and critical scholars call this triangulation: Verify details, facts, quotes, etc. with multiple sources.
* Step 4: Writing Style Analysis. Does the website follow AP Style Guide? Typically, lack of style guide use signifies questionable, more opinion-oriented practices, and may indicate an overall lack of editing or fact-checking process. Does it frequently use ALL CAPS in headlines and/or body text? Does the headline or body of the text use phrases like "WOW!!!!"? This stylistic practice and these types of hyperbolic word choices are often used to create emotional responses with readers that is avoided in more traditional journalism and isn’t something that would be permitted or encouraged by the AP Style Guide
* Step 5: Aesthetic Analysis. Like the style-guide, many fake and questionable news sites utilize very bad design. Are screens are cluttered and they use heavy-handed photo-shopping or born digital images?
* Step 6: Social Media Analysis. Look up the website on Facebook. Do the headlines and posts rely on sensational or provocative language (aka click-bait) in order to attract attention and encourage likes, click-throughs, and shares? Do the headlines and social media descriptions match or accurately reflect the content of the linked article? (this step isn’t particularly good at helping us find fake news, but it can help us identify other misleading news sources)

http://ufsocial.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SourceCredibility.zip  
Story Credibility Assignment   
* Source: where does the story come from? Does the site have an ABOUT page? Does the ABOUT page say what the site’s mission is? Can you find the site’s staff members? Does the site have a physical location and offices where their reporters work? 
* The Headline: headlines are made to be sensational even at legitimate news organizations. Does the body of the story support the headline? Is the headline intended to lead the audience to click on a story but then doesn’t match the headline in tone or content? 
* Author: look at the byline. Who wrote the story? Are they a real person? Does the author have a photograph included? Is the photograph of a real person?  Does the author have an ABOUT page on the site or a biography at the bottom of the story?  
* Supporting Material: even fake news will cite legitimate sources. Does the story link to source material? Does the source support the point made in the story? Often the links go to an official source, but the source material does not support the points made and instead creates the appearance of legitimacy.   
* Check the date: some stories are not fake. Some stories are just old. But these old stories have been repackaged to relate to a current event or are being shared years after the event occurred. 
* Joke: some sites are clearly hoax sites like. Is this a hoax site?
* Are you biased: remember confirmation bias can lead us to believe stories that we want to believe are true. Objective reporting should provide all valid sides to a story. Does the story present just the side you agree with or only presents arguments where you disagree? 
* Check the experts: Factcheck.org, PolitiFact.com, and Snopes.com have already debunked a lot of fake news. So check with them.

<h3 id="watergate">All the President's Men</h3>
All the President's Men, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward (1974)

<blockquote>Gradually, an unwritten rule was evolving: unless two sources confirmed a charge involving activity likely to be considered criminal, the specific allegation was not used in the paper. (p79)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I don't care if it's a word, a phrase, a sentence, a paragraph, a whole story or an entire series of stories," he said. "When in doubt, leave it out."  
—Howard Simons, Managing Editor, Washington Post (p114)</blockquote>

<blockquote>The rule was: Lay it out piece by piece, white what you know is solid; the big picture can wait. (p129)</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Nixon White House worried him. "They are all underhanded and unknowable," he had said numerous times. He also distrusted the press. "I don't like newspapers," he had said flatly. He detested inexactitude and shallowness.  
—Deep Throat (p131)</blockquote>

"Woodward and Bernstein: 40 years after Watergate, Nixon was far worse than we thought"
By Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward June 8, 2012
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/woodward-and-bernstein-40-years-after-watergate-nixon-was-far-worse-than-we-thought/2012/06/08/gJQAlsi0NV_story.html?utm_term=.fca6450c0082

Afterword  
Marking the fortieth anniversary of Watergate

<blockquote><strong>The war on the news media</strong>

In response to suspected leaks to the press about Vietnam, Kissinger had ordered FBI wiretaps in 1969 on the telephones of 17 journalists and White House aides, without court approval. Many news stories based on the purported leaks questioned progress in the American war effort, further fueling the antiwar movement. In a tape from the Oval Office on Feb. 22, 1971, Nixon said, “In the short run, it would be so much easier, wouldn’t it, to run this war in a dictatorial way, kill all the reporters and carry on the war.”

“The press is your enemy,” Nixon explained five days later in a meeting with Adm. Thomas H. Moorer, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, according to another tape. “Enemies. Understand that? . . . Now, never act that way . . . give them a drink, you know, treat them nice, you just love it, you’re trying to be helpful. But don’t help the bastards. Ever. Because they’re trying to stick the knife right in our groin.” 
(p340)</blockquote>

<h3>Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72</h3>

<h3>Murrow</h3>

https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Edward_R._Murrow

<blockquote>American traditions and the American ethic require us to be truthful, but the most important reason is that truth is the best propaganda and lies are the worst. To be persuasive we must be believable; to be believable we must be credible; to be credible we must be truthful. It is as simple as that.  
<cite>Edward R. Murrow, Speaking as the Director of USIA, in <a href="http://pdaa.publicdiplomacy.org/?page_id=6">testimony before a Congressional Committee</a> (May 1963)</cite>
