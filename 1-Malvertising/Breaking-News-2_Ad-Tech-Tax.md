<p>Ad tech is cluttering up people's screens with ads that are designed to deliver accidental clicks that are near-impossible to avoid. In other words, a very significant chunk of your data plan, battery life and time waiting for sites to load are costs you pay to watch the very same ads that are messing up your customer experience.</p>

The Definition Of An Ad Impression

Broken ads, bot traffic, and straight-up fraud…

We start with the notion that only 15% of impressions ever have the possibility to be seen by a real person. Then, factor in that 54% of ads are not viewable (and we already discussed how flawed that metric is), and you’re left with only 8% of impressions that have the opportunity to be seen by a real person. Let me clarify: that does not mean that 8% of impressions are seen. That means only 8% have the chance to be seen. That’s an unbelievable amount of waste in an industry where metrics are a major selling point.

People will hide ads behind other ads, spoof their domain to trick ad networks into serving higher-paying ads on their site, and purposefully send bots to a site to drive up impressions.
