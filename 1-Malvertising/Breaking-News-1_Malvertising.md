<h1>Breaking News: How Monetzing became Malvertising</h2>
Cyber criminals are embezzling billions annually from advertisers. They take over news sites, then spread computer viruses, steal readers' passwords, and hold hard people's drives hostage for a ransom.

It's a tangled world wide web of piracy, fraud, and extortion. Everyone lets it happen: ad agencies, ad networks, and publishers. Everyone gets their cut.

After these attackers decimate the online advertising business and erode all trust in online news, they'll move on. 

Those of you in the news business can then:
* Explain to your readers why your site installed malware on their computers .
* Explain to your advertisers why their high-priced ads were never seen by anyone anywhere.
* Explain to government investigators why you shouldn't be prosecuted for criminal conspiracy.

<h2>Malvertising</h2>
<blockquote>
The other day I mindlessly clicked on some link-bait on my mobile phone. It was an article about "22 Photos that Prove Shaq is a Giant." Yes, I'm embarrassed, but that's not the point. Within that one listicle there were no less than 30 "impressions" of the same Best Foods Mayonnaise banner ad. How embarrassed do you think the brand manager at Best Foods will be when his CMO reads this?

</blockquote>

The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) estimates malicious advertising -- malvertising -- <a href="http://www.iab.com/news/digital-ad-industry-will-gain-8-2-billion-by-eliminating-fraud-and-flaws-in-internet-supply-chain-iab-ey-study-shows/">"costs the U.S. digital marketing, advertising, and media industry $8.2 billion annually."</a> 

A few years ago malvertising was merely scamming the system: fake ads, fake traffic, fake analytics. Ad-tech's unregulated labyrinths of  circumlocution systems, for bidding, placing, and tracking ads, makes it a hacker's heaven.

"All the code is awful and you aren't allowed to change it anyway," says Salon developer Aram Zucker-Scharff. "Usually ad servers claim they run some sort of checks, but considering just how many malicious or badly formed ads get through, it is pretty apparent they don't do much."

The hacker's goal is to bill, make that, bilk advertisers for ads that were never seen. Their fraud takes several forms: Ad stacking piles multiple ads on top of each other. Ad stuffing  or shrinks ads to invisible 1-pixel squares. Click farms send fraud users to real sites. Clickjacking sends real users to fraud sites. 

This example is from Kalkis Research: "You’ll be redirected through a loop of various shell websites, spending a fraction of a second on each." This makes analytics algorithms see these sites as high-quality with lots of traffic. "Once the shell websites have good enough Alexa rankings, and off-the-chart demographics, they sign contracts to display ads with much better terms."

A shell game. A con. That's what malvertising was. Until recently.

<h2>Crime Does Pay... load</h2>
Cyber criminals' new scheme is not just to scam advertisers but also to <em>buy</em> ads. Their new goals: Install spyware, scareware, and ransomware via websites. Make site-visitors' computers part of their "zombie army" attacking more websites and web users. 

<a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">"Ads have become the major vector for malware,"</a> said Maciej Ceglowski in his Web Directions keynote. (I recommend you read <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/">all his talks</a>: He paints unflattering, illuminating, amusing portraits of the modern web.)

Again, ad tech makes this easy: "<a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/new-york-times-bbc-dangerous-ads-ransomware-malvertising/">People think you have to click on the ad for something bad to happen</a>, but that's not the case," said Jerome Segura of the security researchers firm Malwarebytes. "The malicious activity takes place in a few seconds."

Wendy Zamora, also of  Malwarebytes, writes:

<blockquote>
A lot of folks in the business (and consumer) world are shaking in their boots about ransomware. It’s understandable. Ransomware is a dangerous threat and, if not protected against, can do serious damage to a company’s data, reputation, and bottom line.

But the truly alarming part is that ransomware is being delivered by malvertising. Malvertising can do this without you knowing (until it’s too late) and without your users taking a single “unsafe” action online.

Another security company, Bromium,  reported, "<a href="https://www.bromium.com/sites/default/files/rpt-bromium-threat-report-1h2015-us-en.pdf">at least 27 percent of the Alexa 1000 websites were delivering malware via malicious advertisements</a>."  Malwarebytes estimates <a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2016/06/truth-in-malvertising-how-to-beat-bad-ads/">70% of malvertising campaigns deliver ransomware as a payload</a>."

And guess on which sites malvertisers prefer to share their wares.


<h2>We're Number One</h2>
Bromium found more than half "of online adverts with hidden malware" on either news and entertainment websites, with news at the top of the pack (32 percent). Like any marketer malvertisers wants premiere placement at the top sites for their ads. The ad-bidding systems grant them their wish.

In March 2016 CNET reported the websites of The New York Times, BBC, Weather Network, The Hill, Newsweek, AOL, MSN, and NFL all "<a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/new-york-times-bbc-dangerous-ads-ransomware-malvertising/">inadvertently ran malicious ads that attempted to hijack the computers of visitors and demand a ransom</a>."

This even juicier website-breaking news came <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/01/08/you-say-advertising-i-say-block-that-malware/">from Engadget</a>: "Forbes asked readers to turn off ad blockers in order to view the article. After doing so, visitors were immediately served with pop-under malware, primed to infect their computers, and likely silently steal passwords, personal data and banking information."


<h2>What's A Google to Do?</h2>
The problem is not new. Here's some headline from 2013:
* <em>Adweek</em> "The Amount of Questionable Online Traffic Will Blow Your Mind:The World Wide rip-off"

* <em>The Ad Contrarian</em> <a href="http://adcontrarian.blogspot.co.il/2013/06/the-75-billion-ad-swindle.html">"The $7.5 Billion Ad Swindle"</a>

Google has run an <a href="http://www.anti-malvertising.com/">Anti-Malvertising Team</a> since 2009. Here's the latest report on their progress:

<blockquote>

Google is enabling traffic laundering, where websites with pirated content redirect visitors to shell websites displaying AdSense ads. These ads finance piracy, and Google is taking a cut in the process. Google clients have no clue of the reputational risk they run by using AdSense.

For years the Interactive Advertising Bureau and Google have tried to detect fraudulent ads. The results:

Here is their summary:



<h2>Endgame</h2>
Perhaps this partly explains the rapid rise of ad-blockers. Not having your computer hijacked by a crime syndicate seems a reasonable expectation when reading the news.

Ad-tech is not a sustainable business model.  Let's hope news sites are planning for a post-ad-tech world.

<blockquote>
 The Web is turning into a clickbait jungle. Established publishers are trashing their websites with low-quality content recommendations. Smartphone manufacturers and software publishers, worried about worsening browsing experience, are uniting to fight online ads.

Ad dollars are being stolen. Ad efficiency is declining. Traffic laundering is thriving. Bad guys have become experts at gaming ad tech metrics and monetizing fake or unwilling visitors.

Unless ad tech starts to pay attention to the consumer, its days are numbered.

What's slaughtering the news business is not the ads, it's the ad technologies. It's their chumboxes and subprime markets. It's their molasses-slow surveillance scripts and their swiss-cheese security. It's their superstitious belief in "big data" and their exorbitant "ad tech tax." All of which will be explained in future articles in this Breaking News series.
